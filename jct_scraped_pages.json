Lev Bakehila Community Project Lev Bakehila: JCT's flagship community engagement project for the promotion of human rights for persons with disabilities in the Haredi community of Jerusalem. Home Page Community Projects ... About the Lev Bakehila Project About the Lev Bakehila Project Goals JCT's Policy Partner organizations Background In Jerusalem there are between 27,000 and 50,000 Haredi (ultra-orthodox) people with varying degrees of disability. This group includes people with physical, mental, sensory, developmental, and cognitive disabilities who are, therefore, doubly discriminated against by Israeli society. For example, Haredi people with disabilities have higher unemployment rates and greater economic difficulties both in comparison to Haredim who are not disabled and to the secular population with disabilities (Alfassi-Henley, 2014). In addition, there is a serious lack of information regarding their rights and the services in place to assist them which is partly due to poor access to information on the internet and other media. Similarly to people with disabilities from other sectors, members of the Haredi sector with disabilities often experience stigma and shame. This flagship community engagement project of the Jerusalem College of Technology (JCT) – Lev Academic Center was established in the spirit of \"the social model of disability\" that views people with disabilities as having a unique contribution to society and seeks to do everything possible to enable them to fulfill this contribution for their benefit, and, no less importantly, for the benefit of all of society. Project Description Students participating in the project promote the rights of Haredi people with disabilities, their integration as equals into society, and their empowerment. 130 students from all JCT’s campuses, including students from the Haredi community and students with disabilities, participate in the project. The project is run by the Department of Nursing but is open to students from all departments at JCT, studying towards bachelor's as well as master's degrees. The students' activities in the community include four hours each week throughout the academic year. Students participating in the project receive a scholarship as well as a certificate acknowledging their participation in the flagship program. In the early months of the year, students attend training that combines practical-professional aspects, such as information regarding human rights in general and the rights of people with disabilities in particular, as well as theoretical-academic aspects, such as basic concepts of disability studies. The training is provided by academic and professional experts (lawyers, social workers, etc.). During the year, additional training on specific topics adapted to the needs of students in the field is carried out. Upon completion of the training, the students select one of following: Individual Level – advancing knowledge and awareness of rights among people with disabilities, their families and their caregivers, guidance and accompaniment in enacting their rights, and their empowerment. Some of the students deal with short-term inquiries while others accompany people and families with multiple needs over a long period of time providing them with in-depth assistance in order to achieve a significant and sustainable change in their lives. Community Level – creating community projects that address a need that arises from the community. For example, students identified the need to work with sisters of children with disabilities in a Haredi neighborhood and established a group of sisters with whom they have worked for over a year now. Public Policy Level – activities to alter policies or to create new policies, on both the municipal and national levels, particularly on topics that arise from those dealing with the individual and community levels. On each level, the students can choose between one of two tracks. In the first track, the students can volunteer with civil society organizations that partner with the project (for more details, see under “Partner Organizations”). In the second track, students volunteer in the “Lev Bakehilla” Citizens Rights Center. The Center’s mission is to help Haredi people with disabilities familiarize themselves with and realize their rights. This innovative Rights Center was established in collaboration with the Ezer Mizion Organization’s Family Counseling Center . The Rights Center was established as a result of an in-depth study conducted by the students, under the supervision of the project faculty. Their study used interviews to examine the needs of Haredi people with disabilities and their families, their level of knowledge about their rights, the degree to which they have realized their rights, and the best ways to address their needs and help them promote their rights. The students who volunteer at the Rights Center undergo a comprehensive training by experts in each of its issue areas. The Right Center addresses a wide range of issue areas, including housing, education, employment, accessibility, health services, welfare, due process, equality and more. The Center provides services to people with all kinds of disabilities, free of charge. The student volunteers have an entire network of experts from ten non-governmental and municipal organizations (lawyers, social workers, and others) who advise the students in how to help their clients. To the Rights Center's flyer and contact info, click here. In light of studies that indicate the importance of discussion groups for students, regular group meetings are held for volunteers, where they discuss professional, emotional, and ethical dilemmas that arise from operating activities. The meetings allow reflection and group discussion on the work, the challenges it poses, as well as the benefits and opportunities that arise from it. These meetings also help connect the three levels of activity and the students working within them. The training and group sessions allow to put the students’ activism in the broader social, structural, cultural, economic, and political contexts. The flagship project was built for the long term, taking into consideration the importance of a profound and ongoing relationship with the community and long-term continuous social activism of students and staff together with the community. The project is accompanied by a comprehensive evaluation study, which helps develop the project in an effective manner and to maximize the contribution of the project to all those who participate. The evaluation study is based on a written survey, interviews, and observations. Some nursing students participate in a seminar on health, disability, and human rights. This community-engaged seminar deals with social and cultural aspects of disability and their connection with human rights issues. The seminar is given by Dr. Zvika Orr and Dr. Adi Finkelstein. During the seminar, the students map and analyze social realities relating to the lives of people with disabilities from the Haredi community. The project is generously supported by the Council for Higher Education, PERACH, and (in 2018) the Jewish Community Foundation of Greater MetroWest, NJ.

Campus Lustig Located in Ramat Gan, near Tel Aviv, the Lustig Campus was established in 1998 to meet the specific needs of Haredi women and has since gained wide recognition for excellence.  Lustig offers women the environment and conditions necessary to pursue an advanced academic degree while maintaining the values and lifestyle of their ultra-Orthodox upbringing. As a result, the campus empowers women- many of whom are the sole breadwinners in their families- to significantly improve their economic standing and provide them access to professions that were previously inaccessible to the Haredi sector .

Mechina JCT's Mechina (pre-academic preparatory program) enables students who lack the necessary academic background to become college ready in within 16 months. Students begin with a three month pre-academic program in mathematics and English to assess their ability to study in a classroom environment and their academic aptitude. Upon successful completion of the pre-academic program, students enter the mechina program which includes intensive studies in math, English and physics in preparation for their academic studies. The mechina program offers various tracks tailored to students' specific academic goals, enabling them to bolster their proficiency in areas aligned with their chosen degrees. In the summer of 2023, JCT launched a new mechina program for Haredi men and women seeking to become physicians.  The program is designed for students who already have a bachelor’s degree, with classes twice a week for six-hour sessions for three semesters over 15 months, with additional online units for independent study. The goal is to prepare students for success in the entrance examinations at Israel’s medical schools For more information on the mechina programs please contact Noam kedoshim@g.jct.ac.il Jerusalem College of Technology Havaad Haleumi 21, Givat Mordechai 91160, Jerusalem Phone: 02-6751111 OR *3239 Info and Registration: 1-700-50-32-32 Department for Development & External Affairs: 02-6751269 English Program: 02-6751011 For development queries: development@jct.ac.il For Education verification and student queries: maztal@jct.ac.il For queries for the English speaking program: esp@jct.ac.il Video Live Updates on Facebook ‏Jerusalem college of technology 5785 © All rights reserved to Jerusalem College of Technology - Lev Academic Center by: www.TWB.co.il × Need more information?

Programs for Haredim The Naveh Program for Haredi Men Designed to meet the specific requirements of the Haredi community, JCT's degree programs provide Haredi men with the opportunity to pursue an academic degree in combination with in-depth Torah study. The College offers ongoing academic support and prepares Haredi students for the challenges of integrating into a professional  work environment. These valuable skills and tools enable Haredim to successful enter the workforce and become equally contributing members of society. Over the years, JCT gained the trust and quiet approval of leading Haredi Rabbis and community leaders who understand the necessity of empowering their followers to become providers for their families. In the past decade alone, the number of Haredi students at JCT has increased six-fold and programs continue to emerge and develop. These leading programs are successfully empowering Haredim to become active participants in Israel’s booming high-tech industry and contributors to the economy. Haredi Women Traditionally Haredi women were expected to pursue specific career paths such as teaching that have limited earning potential. Often the main bread winners of their families, many Haredi women are eager to explore new career paths to increase their income. JCT’s academic programs are successfully providing these women access to high earning career opportunities that were never previously available. There are currently over 1000 Haredi women enrolled at JCT and these numbers continue to grow. Impacting Social Change Providing Haredim with the necessary tools and skills to work as equals in Israel’s competitive workforce and become contributors to the economy Reducing dependence on government and social support Breaking down social barriers and stigmas between sectors Mechina (pre- academic) Preparatory Program Lacking basic STEM education required for entry into academia, the majority of Haredi students participate in JCT’s intensive pre-academic preparatory program. The program offers  students the opportunity to fast-track their education and become college-ready after a year of intensive study. JCT provides counselling, extensive tutoring as well as reinforcement courses in English and math to ensure each student receives the academic and emotional support they need to succeed. The College also offers psycho-didactic evaluations to students suffering from undiagnosed learning disabilities. We believe that proper diagnosis significantly impacts their chances for success.

Ethiopian Program The Reuven Surkis Program for Students from the Ethiopian Community JCT empowers young Ethiopian men and women to improve their lives by enabling them to earn an academic degree and pursue careers in high-tech, business and the IDF.  Dedicated to promoting socio-economic mobility, JCT was one of the first Israeli institutions of higher education to offer specialized programs for the Ethiopian community in the fields of science and engineering. As a result of cultural difference, many potential students from Ethiopian backgrounds lack a strong academic foundation in STEM (science, technology, engineering and math) subjects and do not have adequate matriculation scores to directly enter JCT’s academic programs.  Often, they are the first generation in their families to pursue studies at an higher education institution. JCT offers a one-year, intensive Mechina (pre-academic preparatory program) to advance their academic skills and knowledge of Mathematics, English and Physics.  The Mechina provides private tutoring, reinforcement courses and individual counseling to ensure students have the conditions and support they need to succeed.  The Mechina’s Mentorship Program offers new students an opportunity to study with 4 th year students in their program who can offer extra help as well as serve as a role model. To date, over 180 students have graduated from the Reuven Surkis Program for Students from the Ethiopian Community program and more than 50% have gone on to pursue graduate studies.  Ninety-five percent of Ethiopian alumni are employed in a range of professions in their fields.  In addition to changing the lives of those students who have graduated from JCT, advancing Ethiopian Israelis impacts the broader Ethiopian community and generates new paradigms for success. In 2009 a scholarship fund was established in memory of Major Ilan Meir Raiz z\"l for students from the Ethiopian community.

The Atudai track is a 10-year program, consisting of four years of academic studies, followed by six years of military service in the IDF as officers in cutting-edge high-tech areas. After the 10 years, graduates can either remain in the IDF as career officers or go on to have highly successful careers in high-tech, business, public service and academia.

News & Updates Having outgrown its rented facilities, The Jerusalem College of Technology has embarked on an ambitious $120 million capital campaign to construct a new state-of-the-art Tal Campus for Women located at Jerusalem’s newest major intersection, connecting the Tel Aviv and Begin Highways. In addition to fully equipped, modern classrooms, high-tech laboratories, simulation labs and a state-of-the-art multimedia library , the new Tal Campus will offer attractive dormitories with support services including on-site childcare. The Garden of Psalms, the aesthetic centerpiece of the new Tal Campus for Women , will provide funders with a unique opportunity to contribute to a monumental new Jerusalem artwork portraying the Book of Psalms in stained glass panels, created to eternalize the Jewish values represented by the JCT vision. Home Page Tal Campus  Project ... News & Updates Tal Campus for Women Campus News & Updates Gallery Donate Now Jerusalem College of Technology Breaks Ground on Trailblazing New Women’s Campus New Tal Campus is poised to expand opportunities and empower women to pursue higher education and attain employment in science, high-tech, business and nursing May 31, 2022 (Jerusalem, Israel) — The Jerusalem College of Technology (JCT) on Monday broke ground on its new Tal Campus for women, marking a notable academic and socioeconomic milestone for the city of Jerusalem. Attended by dignitaries including Mayor of Jerusalem Moshe Lion , the groundbreaking ceremony highlighted how the $100 million Tal Campus project amplifies JCT’s decades-long role in bolstering the Israeli capital’s economic and cultural footprint. Speaking via video, Prime Minister Naftali Bennett said, “[JCT] has been providing a unique Israeli educational experience – one that combines quantitative subjects with the study of Torah. Many of the Center’s alumni have found their place in engineering, life sciences, health, management and more. Today, I celebrate with you as you lay the cornerstone of the new Tal Campus, a new hope for women to study academia and Torah. This new home of Torah and mada (science) is the next step in fulfilling the center’s vision to bridge academic studies with Jewish studies.” Currently, the Tal Campus accommodates over 2,100 women studying at JCT. Slated for completion in 2025, the new women’s campus will be the permanent home of academic excellence for up to 3,000 female students in nursing, computer science, industrial engineering, accounting, and management. The campus is poised to provide increased opportunities for religious women to pursue higher education and attain quality employment in scientific and high-tech industries. It will enable the opening of an industrial engineering and management track as well as a new nursing program for Haredi women, a new pharmacy track, and the College’s recently announced business administration program for women which will be offered in English. The Tal Campus also offers a sensitive environment for religious women, and helps many women break the cycle of poverty in their underserved communities through greater access to higher education, while connecting them with gainful employment and ambitious career paths upon graduation. “Sadly, for too long, we have not appreciated what you at JCT have always known,” Mayor of Jerusalem, Moshe Lion, said. “For too long, the religious women of Jerusalem, have not had the facilities they deserve to study and gain qualifications. [Yet] this important community is already becoming the rosh pina , the cornerstone of Jerusalem’s high-tech economy.” As such, JCT reflects how the 4,700-student College makes disproportionately large contributions to academic excellence in nursing, computer science, and engineering in the city of Jerusalem and across Israel. The school is a leader in integrating Haredi men and women into the workforce and is home to over 2,000 Haredi students, 1,300 of whom are women who have been underrepresented in the local job market and the Start-up Nation in particular. The school boasts the best nursing school in Israel with its Selma Jelinek School of Nursing which has the largest number of undergraduate and graduate nursing students studying in Jerusalem and nearly fifteen percent of Israel’s female undergraduate students in computer science. Thus, with healthcare and hi-tech sectors significantly understaffed in Israel, JCT is filling those vital voids with a quality pool of talent. “Part of JCT’s mission has been to identify pressing socioeconomic needs in Israeli society, which in the past has included integration of Russian and Ethiopian students over the decades. And now, we are at the forefront of Haredi integration,” said JCT Vice President Stuart Hershkowitz. “The new Tal Campus expansion will allow us to integrate Haredi women in a state-of-the-art facility. We are simultaneously empowering religious women to shatter stereotypes of their lagging interest in science and technology, igniting an ongoing wave of Haredi integration into the workforce, and combating the unacceptable levels of poverty in Jerusalem. The new Tal Campus will operate as the fulcrum of this socio-economic revolution.” Jerusalem College of Technology Receives Government Approval to Expand Campus The Jerusalem College of Technology (JCT) yesterday announced that it has received approval from the Israel Land Authority to significantly expand the College’s grounds through the construction of the new Tal Campus for Women. The expansion of JCT — which is home to approximately 5,000 students from religious backgrounds, making it Jerusalem’s second-largest academic institution — aligns with the broader plans spearheaded by the Ministry of Jerusalem Affairs and Heritage to position the capital as a national hub for academic excellence in science, technology, and other disciplines. As the permanent home for up to 3,000 of JCT’s female students in nursing, computer science, electro-optics, industrial engineering, accounting, and management, the new Tal Campus will provide increased opportunities for national religious, Haredi, and Ethiopian women to pursue higher education and attain quality employment in scientific and high-tech industries. The decision was made in accordance with larger plans spearheaded by the Office of Jerusalem Affairs and Heritage for the city which include making Jerusalem a national hub for education and academia. “Promoting technology education in Jerusalem and attracting students to this discipline is a significant goal for the city,” said Minister of Housing and Construction Ze'ev Elkin, who heads the Israel Land Authority as well as the Ministry of Jerusalem Affairs and Heritage. “Under my leadership, the Ministry of Jerusalem Affairs and Heritage will continue to invest its resources in academics and ensure that students from all walks of life are properly integrated into higher education and the job market.” The Tal Campus construction project, which made significant strides despite the potential obstacle of the COVID-19 pandemic, is on track to break ground early this year. The current Tal Campus accommodates approximately 2,000 women, including 1,400 from the Haredi community. After completion of the new Tal Campus, JCT expects to be able to accommodate 3,000 students, many of whom will study in allocated tracks for Haredi population. The new Tal Campus will also enable the opening of a new industrial engineering and management track for Haredi women. “As the second-largest academic institution in Jerusalem, JCT’s rapid development is a necessity,” said Uriel Ben-Nun, the College’s Vice President of Construction and Infrastructure. The Israel Land Authority’s approval will bring this expansion to fruition, and we hope to break ground on the new Tal Campus soon.” JCT’s academic programs for women have produced job placement rates of over 90 percent for Haredim and other underserved students, with alums securing immediate employment upon graduation in leading firms such as Intel, Texas Instruments, Check Point, and IBM. “The new Tal Campus will take JCT’s work to empower students from Israel’s underserved populations to new heights, including by helping women shatter the proverbial glass ceiling and debunk stereotypes surrounding their lagging interest in science and technology careers,” said JCT Vice President Stuart Hershkowitz. “We are grateful for the government’s latest resounding vote of confidence in our institutional vision, and eager to accelerate this impactful mission for the benefit of Jerusalem and the entire nation.” Toronto Venture Capitalist Larry Krauss Touts the Promise of the Tal Campus Long before his career in real estate and venture capital, Larry Krauss studied biochemistry at the University of Toronto. Today, his ongoing support for the Jerusalem College of Technology brings his passions and experiences full circle. Through Terracap Ventures, Krauss is a strategic investment partner in a variety of cutting-edge technology companies internationally, and he serves on the board of several such entities, including Cellint, Satixfy, Helix, Silentium and TSU. Krauss says that Terracap Ventures has invested in more than 45 startups — including some which have been launched by JCT students. “I’m always interested in promoting advanced science and technology as well as advancing the boundaries of what can be done with science,” Krauss says. “It’s important for me to see a school in Israel like JCT that can take students who would otherwise not have an exposure to science — such as those from the Haredi community — and turn them into computer engineers, electro-optical engineers, and professionals who are able to advance the interests of the state and the interests of their community, while still maintaining their connection to Judaism and Torah.” Terracap Ventures is part of Krauss’ Terracap Group of Companies, a Toronto-based fully integrated owner, developer, and operator of high-quality real estate assets across North America. His latest support for JCT, meanwhile, comes in his capacity as a member of the Tal Campus Steering Committee. As the permanent home for up to 3,000 of JCT’s female students in nursing, computer science, electro-optics, industrial engineering, accounting, and management, the new Tal Campus will provide increased opportunities for national religious, Haredi, and Ethiopian women to pursue higher education and attain quality employment in scientific and high-tech industries. The Toronto businessman attended JCT for approximately two months in 1970, the second year of the College’s existence. When his father died, Krauss decided to return home, and was accepted to University of Toronto. Even though it was short, Krauss’ time as a JCT student was still memorable, including his impressions of the College’s founder Prof. Ze’ev Lev. “Professor Lev stressed offering the highest-quality education in every discipline that the College offers — not just helping graduates get jobs, but creating excellence, for students and faculty who are focused on excellence,” he says. Twenty-five years after Krauss left the Jerusalem campus, Kurt Rothschild asked him to become Chair of Canadian Friends of JCT. In the ensuing years, CFJCT has raised its profile through hosting various gala events and conferring honorary degrees to high-profile Canadian dignitaries, including former Prime Minister Stephen Harper, former Finance Minister Joe Oliver, and Premier of Alberta Jason Kenney. CFJCT has also posthumously honored Krauss’ grandparents Rabbi Eliezer and Chaya Weinberger, who both died in concentration camps during the Holocaust. Now, the Tal Campus project has provided Krauss with another avenue to advance his passion for JCT’s mission. “The integration of women into high-tech, nursing, health informatics, business, and other fields is a tremendous use of women’s energy, creativity, and intelligence,” he says. “It helps maximize the human potential, especially for women from the Haredi world who might not otherwise attend university.” Thoughts From Morry Weiss - Tal Campus Honorary Chairman Morry Weiss sets sights on empowering Israel’s religious women through higher education As the former chairman of American Greetings, the world’s second-largest greeting card producer, Morry Weiss knows a strong value proposition when he sees one. These days, the Cleveland philanthropist is advocating for the value of connecting Israel’s underserved populations with greater opportunities in higher education and employment. Weiss and his wife Judy were recently named the honorary chairs of the Jerusalem College of Technology’s (JCT) Tal Campus Campaign. The college’s new Tal Campus for women is on track to break ground in early 2022. As the permanent home for up to 3,000 of JCT’s female students in nursing, computer science, electro-optics, industrial engineering, accounting, and management, the campus will provide increased opportunities for national religious, Haredi, and Ethiopian women to pursue higher education and attain quality employment in scientific and high-tech industries. “We agreed to chair the Tal Campus Campaign because we believe JCT is a crucial institution in Israel that makes a wonderful contribution to both individuals and the state when it comes to providing education and creating career opportunities,” said Weiss, whose family has supported JCT since the college was founded in 1969. According to Weiss, supporting the Tal Campus aligns with his belief that while Israel “has done a fine job in breaking the proverbial glass ceiling, religious women haven’t had the same opportunities as men in the workforce. Progress is being made. Providing academic training and education is critical for religious women and adds to the vitality of the economy.” Judy Weiss, he noted, “has been been a strong force in creating educational opportunities for women.” JCT is known for its track record of strengthening Israel’s labor market through working to increase technology-related educational and employment opportunities for underserved populations. The college’s Haredi graduates attain an 89-percent employment rate, far exceeding the roughly 50-percent employment rate for Haredi men throughout Israel. Further, 53 percent of all JCT’s computer science students are women, which is 18 percent higher than any other Israeli academic institution. “We have become fascinated by JCT’s efforts within the Haredi segment of Israel’s population,” Morry Weiss said. “We believe that from a long-term perspective, providing Haredi Israelis with quality job opportunities is an unbelievable benefit to Israel; they can make enormous contributions. Higher education in no way compromises their personal commitment to Judaism, but it also means they can gain respectable employment and help grow the Israeli economy.” He continued, “There’s no question that we’re dealing with a highly intelligent segment of the population. Young Haredi men and women have experienced the benefit of a great deal of Torah study, which has sharpened their minds and their skills. What we need to do is train them for careers. We mostly train them for good entry-level positions, with aspirations to grow. In some cases, we can directly prepare them for higher level employment (as JCT has done with its specialized Cyber Security programs).  Many of these fields require continuous education and training, or even career changes to allow professionals to provide for their family. Everyone strives to support a family no matter their level of observance, and JCT is making all of that possible.” The preceding generation in the Weiss family identified with JCT as an institution that enables its students to balance a college education with Torah learning. The family has also known JCT President Chaim Sukenik since his time as a professor of chemistry at Case Western Reserve University in Cleveland and then at Bar-Ilan University. The Weiss’s leadership of the Tal Campus Campaign adds to the family’s legacy of broad support for Jewish and Israeli causes. Morry Weiss has served on the boards of directors for Bar-Ilan University, the Jewish Community Federation of Cleveland, the Orthodox Union, and Yeshiva University (YU), including as the YU board’s chairman. “My great-grandfather would have done anything to see this period of growth and success in — Israel is a miracle — and it happened in our generation,” Weiss said. “We have that obligation to continue that and to enhance it.” Rosh Hashana Letter from Morry Weiss Before deciding to pursue an undergraduate degree at JCT’s Tal Campus for Women, Tammy Mandel—the oldest of 11 siblings from a Belz Hassidic family—sewed garments at a factory in Bnei Brak. Determined to improve her family’s socio-economic status and to contribute meaningfully to Israeli society, Tammy excelled first in her computer science studies and then in the Cyber Elite Program for outstanding graduates at JCT. Today, Tammy analyzes computer code at Intel to ensure that it’s hack-free. Stories like Tammy’s are repeated a hundredfold each year at JCT. By developing the untapped potential of talented men and women from among Israel’s disadvantaged communities, we apply an approach as innovative as any Intel technology to the challenge of meeting Israel’s need for computer programmers, healthcare workers, and software engineers. And now, in the most significant step since the founding of JCT nearly half a century ago, we are launching a $75 million campaign to build a permanent home for the Tal Campus—and prepare thousands more women like Tammy to power the Startup Nation and build a better future for their families. We have already raised more than 50 percent of the amount needed for this ambitious campaign, set to be one of the largest capital projects in Jerusalem in the coming decade. We now invite you to partner in this unbeatable project. If you seek an out-of-the-box, forward-thinking, multi-faceted means of advancing the Jewish state, you’ll find it in the new Tal Campus. Gmar Chatima Tova JCT Kicks Off $100 Million Campaign for Tal Campus with Over Half Raised in Major Gifts This month, the Jerusalem College of Technology (JCT) kicked off its largest capital campaign since its establishment, announcing it has already raised $57 million in gifts toward its goal of $100 million by 2025. The campaign will support the construction of a new, 325,000 square-feet Tal Campus for Women adjacent to the Lev Campus for Men. The Tal Campus, future home to 3,000 students in engineering and computer science, nursing, and business management, will cement JCT’s role as an engine of growth for Jerusalem, and in particular its booming hi-tech ecosystem… Among the major gifts to date is a $15 million donation from an anonymous Israeli donor, given to launch the Tal Campus campaign. The Leona M. and Harry B. Helmsley Charitable Trust have provided another $9 million for the construction of the Helmsley Life and Health Sciences building on the Tal Campus, which will be home to one of Israel’s largest nursing programs and most advanced nursing simulation laboratories. Recognized as the country’s premier nursing program, JCT received the Israeli Ministry of Health’s National Prize for Excellence in 2020. The Israel Henry Beren Charitable Foundation, a longstanding supporter of modern Orthodox Jewish education in Israel and America, donated $9 million for the construction of the new engineering building, future home of the renamed Beren Center for Engineering. Today, one out of every five female computer science student in Israel studies at JCT, and women account for a full 40 percent of JCT’s engineering graduates. Additional major gifts include $2 million from Atta and Henry Zieleniec of Toronto, Canada, for the Selma Jelinek School of Nursing in the Helmsley Life and Health Sciences building. The school is named for Atta’s mother, known as “nurse Selma,” who became a nurse in the Russian army after escaping the Nazis in the town of Koretz. Finally, Judy and Morry Weiss of Cleveland, Ohio contributed $1 million, with Morry also serving as co-chairman of the Tal Campus for Women Campaign. “We are deeply grateful for the generosity and visionary leadership of JCT’s partners, without whom the new Tal Campus for Women for would not be possible,” stated Prof. Chaim Sukenik, president of JCT. “Their support will enable us to train thousands more talented women to advance their own lives and those of their families and communities. But perhaps most important, this support will ensure that JCT serves as a critical resource for the Startup Nation, contributing significantly to Israel’s health, security, and prosperity.” Better than the Real Thing? Tal Campus’ School of Nursing Aims to be National Leader in Simulation No one wants to be the first patient on which a nursing student practices intubation, a challenging and highly uncomfortable procedure that involves navigating a breathing tube down the throat—and the control and confidence for which it can take years and dozens of patients to develop. For precisely that reason, of course, no nursing student particularly wants to learn on a real patient, either. With astonishingly lifelike mannequins that can bleed, cry, and even suffer realistic seizures and strokes, however, they may not need to: Nursing students with access to today’s advanced simulation labs can gain important practice long before encountering those high-pressure, high-stakes medical situations that require quick thinking and a steady hand. While the value of nursing simulations has long been appreciated—offering practice in a safe, supportive, and risk-free environment being the most obvious among them—the integration of advanced technologies has both expanded the range of medical conditions with which a nursing student can contend and enhanced the efficiency of the learning experience at the same time. For this reason, the training students obtain in simulation labs is largely considered superior to that of regular practicums, with Israel’s Health Ministry recommending that up to a third of a nurse’s training take place in a simulation lab. For nursing students in Jerusalem, however, that was often easier said than done. That is, until now. Currently, Jerusalem is home to just a small number of simulation labs, too few and too small to accommodate the growing number of nursing students in the capital’s schools. Moreover, most of these labs contain outdated equipment, making a trip to Tel Aviv’s Tel Hashomer Hospital a necessity for essential training sessions. To provide its own students with the best possible training, as well as to offer its many healthcare partners in Jerusalem and the city’s hospitals a valuable and much-needed resource, JCT plans to build a new, state-of-the-art, 1,300 square feet Simulation Center in its Selma Jelinek School of Nursing. Named in honor of Holocaust survivor and Russian army nurse Selma Jelinek, JCT’s Selma Jelinek School of Nursing was established in 2007 to address the growing shortage of nurses in Israel: With just five nurses for every 1,000 patients, the Jewish state currently ranks among the lowest 25 percent of developed countries in nurse-to-patient rations, according to the OECD. Soon after, JCT launched a collaborative program with Jerusalem’s Shaare Zedek Medical Center as well as a parallel BSN program for men. Boasting an extraordinary 100 pass rate on national accreditation exams and the highest scores nationwide, the program was awarded the Health Ministry’s National Prize for Excellence. Now, with the construction of a new home for the Tal Campus, the Selma Jelinek School of Nursing has set itself a still more ambitious goal: Become a national leader in nursing simulation. Located in the Leona M. & Harry B. Helmsley Life and Health Sciences building, the Simulation Center will comprise two, separate yet complementary facilities. The Nursing Simulation Center will feature state-of-the-art laboratories for training in emergency medicine, pediatrics, orthopedics, internal medicine, and surgery, as well as training suites for labor and delivery and mock operation rooms. Designed by leading experts in the simulation-training field, the center will also feature viewing booths, a lecture hall, and advanced equipment for lifting, moving, and bathing patients, as well as a full audio-visual system for data collection and feedback. The adjacent Health Sciences Simulation Center will allow hospital, community, and emergency sectors to provide training and orientation for new staff in various healthcare fields, and its laboratories’ design and equipment determined in accordance with the needs of Jerusalem HMOs, hospitals, and community clinics. The Health Sciences Simulation Center will also be available for commercial use and will provide needed revenue for enhancing clinical education at JCT. “This new facility will expand JCT’s excellent nursing degree programs, allow it to grow its student body, and help to alleviate the unfortunate shortage of nurses in Israel,” said Sandor Frankel, a trustee of the Helmsley Charitable Trust, which granted JCT a $9 million lead gift for the Tal Campus project last year. “We are committed to supporting quality healthcare in Israel, and enabling JCT to graduate more highly-trained nurses and other medical personnel will be a win for the country.” Award-Winning Israeli Architects Selected to Design Tal Campus, One of Jerusalem’s Most Important Capital Projects of the Coming Decade Jerusalem College of Technology (JCT) has selected Kimmel Eshkolot as the architectural firm for the design of the new Tal Campus for Women, future home to 3,000 students in engineering and computer science, nursing, and business management. Set to be one of Jerusalem’s most important capital projects of the coming decade, the 325,000 square-feet Tal Campus will connect the capital’s existing innovation clusters and provide a pipeline of talented professionals for its thriving hi-tech industry. Known for the design of high-profile public projects, including the Davidson Museum in the archaeological park near the Western Wall, the Memorial Hall for Israel’s Fallen Soldiers at Mount Herzl, the Steinhardt Museum of Natural History at Tel Aviv University, and the restoration of Tel Aviv’s historical Neve Tzedek neighborhood, Kimmel Eshkolot are recipients of the Rokach Prize for Architecture, the International Award for Excellence, and the Rechter Prize for Architecture, considered the most prestigious prize for architecture in Israel. Kimmel Eshkolot’s winning design will combine its signature attention to context with a commitment to sustainable-architecture principles. Designed around a central courtyard that overlooks Jerusalem’s Gazelle Valley, the Tal Campus features an open amphitheater and a series of courtyards and roof gardens that both complement the landscape and extend it into the campus’ buildings themselves. Along with the engineering, life and health sciences, and administration buildings, the campus will also include a library, a fitness center, an auditorium, a day-care center, and a cafeteria open to the expansive view. The Garden of Psalms, the campus’ aesthetic centerpiece, will feature 150 stained-glass panels designed by Ofra Friedland, considered one of Israel’s most significant contemporary artists. The panels will be available for dedication by supporters of the Tal Campus. “Kimmel Eshkolot is privileged to lead the design of the Tal Campus for Women, and to help ensure its status as an iconic yet integral part of the city’s landscape,” said Etan Kimmel, co-founder of Kimmel Eshkolot. “We hope the campus itself will speak to JCT’s aspiration to bring the diverse aspects of Jerusalem and Israeli society in general into creative and fruitful dialogue.” Prof. Chaim Sukenik, president of JCT, described Kimmel Eshkolot’s winning design as the “best reflection of our vision for the Tal Campus as a symbol of deep respect for Jerusalem’s history and the tradition it represents, as well as of its future as the capital of the Startup Nation.” Construction on the $75 million Tal Campus is slated to begin in early 2022, and the first of its three phases to be complete in the fall of 2024.

Prof Bodenheimer z\"l The Board of Trustees, Executive Committee, Rabbis, faculty, graduates and students deeply mourn the loss of the fourth President of the Jerusalem College of Technology (JCT), Professor Joseph (Yosef Shlomo) Bodenheimer z”l. A life-long Zionist who loved working with young people, Prof. Bodenheimer will be remembered for his passionate interest in Torah and science. 14.8.2024 Born in 1941 in Cambridge, England, Joseph Bodenheimer moved with his family to the new State of Israel, at the age of eight. He served in the Israel Defense Forces, was awarded a Fulbright Scholarship in 1961 (which he declined) and received his Ph.D. from the Hebrew University. During post-doctoral studies in laser spectrometry at King's College, London University, Prof. Bodenheimer discovered two previously unknown phase transitions and developed a new spectrometric technique.  During a Sabbatical in 1978 at Kodak Laboratories, as their first non-American guest researcher, he carried out ground-breaking research in the field of DVDs. With the founding of the Jerusalem College of Technology (Machon Lev) in 1969, Prof. Bodenheimer joined the Department of Electro-optics and was appointed Department head in 1982, subsequently becoming a full Professor of Electro-optics two years later.  In 1989 he was elected rector. He then served as president of JCT for sixteen years until 2009. Under his leadership, JCT became a world-class institute combining Torah and academic studies, supporting Israel’s position as a global hi-tech superpower. Upon his retirement, Professor Bodenheimer became Editor-in-chief of B’Or Ha’Torah , the Journal of Science, Life and Art in the Light of Torah. JCT published eight volumes of this peer-reviewed journal on the interrelationship of Judaism, science and technology, psychology, the arts, and social issues between 2010 and 2022. Professor Bodenheimer helped make Israel a world leader in the field of optical engineering through his students and his own applied research. Awarded substantial research grants from institutes and foundations throughout the world, he published over 80 papers and held 11 patents for a broad range of electro-optical devices and systems. He served as consultant for numerous technology companies in Israel and the United States and was a member of several national scientific committees. Professor Bodenheimer set aside time for daily Torah study and gave regular shiurim and lectures on Torah and science all over the world. A founding member of the California chapter of the Association of Orthodox Jewish Scientists, he was a member of the Zomet Institute for Halacha and Technology, a member of the board of Nishmat Center for Advanced Torah Study for Women, and was past president of Ramban Synagogue in Katamon, Jerusalem. Prof. Joseph Bodenheimer was the driving force behind Machon Lev’s dynamic growth as the only college in Israel combining the academic disciplines of sophisticated technology, contemporary business and management, with intensive Jewish studies. Under his leadership, Machon Naveh for Haredi men and Machon Lustig for Haredi women were established. He went on to found Machon Tal in September 2000, the first academic program to offer religious women the opportunity to study engineering, health care and management in a religious environment and created special programs for new immigrants from Ethiopia, Russia, France, South America and English-speaking countries. In 2019, Prof. Bodenheimer was named a Yakir Yerushalayim with the awarding of the Jerusalem Citizenship Award by Mayor Moshe Lion and the Jerusalem Municipality. The Jerusalem College of Technology mourns the loss of a charismatic and brilliant leader. May his memory will serve as a blessing to us always. יהי זכרו ברוך share in social medias: Previous Update Next Update More Updates Where does Israel go from here?

Join Us in Jerusalem: Vibrant Zionist Torah Community Advancing Academic Excellence Home Page News and Updates ... CNS letter May 6th 2024 20 Nissan 5784 28 April 2024 Dear Friends, The Jerusalem College of Technology is watching the rapid rise of antisemitism on college campuses across North America with growing concern. Recent events have underscored the urgent need for a safe and supportive environment for Jewish students, who deserve the opportunity to pursue their educational goals without fear of discrimination or persecution. At the Jerusalem College of Technology (JCT), we provide such a setting. We have a long-standing tradition of achieving academic excellence alongside high-level Torah study, on gender separated campuses. For the past 55 years, our dual curriculum has produced generations of Israeli leadership. JCT offers international students the opportunity to pursue degrees in Computer Science, Nursing, Pre-Med, Business Administration, Engineering and Applied Physics, and Bioinformatics. Our school boasts the highest percentage of Olim (recent immigrants) of any Israeli academic institution, who create a warm and welcoming community. Starting this Fall, Rabbi Shalom Rosner will lead our English-speaking Beit Midrash and reimagine Torah learning in Jerusalem. Moreover, we recently welcomed the Orthodox Union’s JLIC, significantly strengthening student social life. Students do not need to make Aliyah to study at JCT and non-Israeli students can earn a degree for less than $15,000 per year. In light of the climate on North American campuses, JCT is opening a special opportunity for students interested in transferring into our existing Computer Science and Business Administration programs starting on May 15, 2024. Transfer students and prospective first-year students interested in other degrees are welcome to apply for the upcoming academic year (Fall 2024). We will also accept students who wish to spend a semester or two at JCT. Direct inquiries to JCT English Speaking Program Director, Rabbi Shlomo Anapolle . The wave of antisemitic, anti-Israel sentiment has not only affected students. JCT invites faculty members, post-docs, and even students nearing the completion of their PhD to join our elite academic staff. Currently, we have teaching and research opportunities available in Computer Science, Engineering, and Health Sciences. Direct inquiries to JCT Rector, Professor Dan Bouhnik . By joining us in Jerusalem, students and faculty will further their academic and professional goals by joining a vibrant Zionist community, dedicated to Torah study and academic excellence. We look forward to welcoming you to the Jerusalem College of Technology.

Foxbrumer Netanel Foxbrumer's Outstanding Contributions during the Swords of Iron War April 16 2024 Netanel Foxbrumer, a senior lecturer in the Selma Jelinek School of Nursing at JCT, received an award from President Herzog for his work in the Swords of Iron War. Together with fellow faculty members, Foxbrumer co-founded the organization כל ישראל אחים ואחיות, to encourage volunteering among those in healthcare professions. In the tumultuous early days of the war, amidst widespread confusion and apprehension, chronically ill patients faced sudden disruptions in their medical care. Swiftly responding to this urgent need, the newly established organization mobilized volunteer healthcare workers, who diligently attended to patients in their homes, organized by geographical proximity and medical expertise. This initiative ensured patients continued to receive the critical healthcare they required, all thanks to the dedicated efforts of the organization's volunteers. Furthermore, recognizing the immediate threat of medical emergencies throughout the country due to the war's impact, Netanel Foxbrumer spearheaded fundraising endeavors to purchase and distribute essential first-aid medical kits to emergency response workers across the country. Alongside this, Foxbrumer also conducted informational sessions on life-saving techniques, attended by hundreds of healthcare professionals including nurses, doctors, paramedics, and medics. share in social medias: Previous Update Next Update More Updates Where does Israel go from here?

Golochiev's interview wht channel 7 Dr Yossi Golobchiev from JCT's Electronics department discusses the recent scrambling of Israel's GPS systems, and how it relates to security April 2024 Translated from original article in Hebrew from Channel 7 Recent disruptions to GPS services in central Israel are being seen as defensive measures against a possible missile attack from Iran. Dr. Yossi Golobchiev, from the Jerusalem College of Technology, sheds light on how missile targeting systems are linked to GPS navigation. Notices of GPS interference in Israel’s central region have emerged, linked to defenses against a potential Iranian missile assault. We engaged with Dr. Yossi Golobchiev, a specialist at Jerusalem College of Technology, for insights on the interplay between GPS navigation and missile guidance systems. Dr. Golobchiev outlines that missile guidance often relies on GPS signals. Jamming these signals can thwart a missile’s path. “By disrupting GPS signals, you hinder a missile’s guidance system, affecting its trajectory,” he explains. He further highlights the challenge in distinguishing between military and civilian GPS use. “The ubiquity of GPS technology means it’s as accessible to civilians as it is to potential threats,” Dr. Golobchiev remarks, noting the expanded use of frequency jammers and their intensity as a precaution against widespread attacks. Golobchiev notes that \"the defense systems have additional infrastructure systems. There is satellite communication for military purposes and there are radar systems .” On legal and technical fronts, Golobchiev emphasizes that frequency jamming is prohibited to civilians, underscoring the complexities of deploying such measures without affecting civilian infrastructure. When asked about the broader impact of GPS jamming, Dr. Golobchiev acknowledges potential disruptions across various sectors, including aviation and military communications. He remains optimistic, however, about a return to normalcy once security risks subside. In anticipation of a future with autonomous vehicles reliant on GPS, Dr. Golobchiev stresses the importance of developing resilient emergency backup systems to safeguard against navigation disruptions.

Opening of School Year with Moving Prayer Ceremony Home Page News and Updates ... Atzeret HaTefilla After a two-month delay, JCT marked the opening of the school year with a moving prayer ceremony in its Beit Midrash to welcome students December 24 2023 After a two-month delay, JCT marked the opening of the school year with a moving prayer ceremony in its Beit Midrash to welcome students. The emotional service included remarks from JCT President Prof. Chaim Sukenik; Rector Bouhnik; Rabbi Yosef Zvi Rimon, Rabbinic Head of JCT; Rabbi Amnon Hedri the head of JCT’s Beit Midrash; Rabbi Doron Perez, Executive Chairman of World Mizrachi; and Rabbi Menachem Kalmanson, a teacher in the Ohr Otniel yeshiva High School. Rabbi Hedri spoke about the significance of attending JCT - a school that values both religious and secular studies. “We are all fighting for a strong Jewish state where one can worship God, value science and also experience the power of Torah. This is a life that will bestow good and kindness to the entire world.” he said. “Just because we try to resume normal life, doesn’t mean we’re forgetting about those fighting for us in Gaza. It is because of them that we are able to go back and resume our studies. What’s more, JCT is dedicated to ensuring that soldiers receive the support they need so that the school year is not lost.” Prof. Sukenik added that the school chose to begin the year with collective prayer because the entire nation is praying for their loved ones and coming together solidifies the notion “that all of Israel is responsible for one another.” He added that “the combined perspectives of different individuals praying together enriches and enhances the power of the prayer”. Rabbi Perez spoke to the audience about his two sons who are both IDF soldiers. Rabbi Perez hasn’t heard from one of his sons since the war began and he is presumed to be captive in Gaza. Meanwhile, his other son (who had been injured in battle) recently got married. Rabbi Perez described the bittersweet moment of standing under the chuppah as his son got married while the other son’s fate remains unknown. In many ways, he suggested, his experience represents the collective experience of the country that is in grief, but still wants to celebrate life. Also speaking at the ceremony was Rabbi Menachem Kalmanson who, along with his brother Elchanan OBM, was responsible for saving over 100 people in Kibbutz Be’eri. He recalled the harrowing experience where he broke into one of the houses in the kibbutz by throwing a washing machine through the window. While under fire from terrorists, Rabbi Kalmanson begged the family who locked themselves in the safe room to come out. Suspecting that Kalmanson was a Hamas terrorist pretending to be an Israeli, the family refused to open the door. It was only when Kalmanson recited the Shema prayer that the family believed him, came out of the shelter and allowed themselves to be ushered to safety. Elchanan was killed by a terrorist who hid in one of the houses. “After these words we can see who the people of Israel really are,” Rabbi Rimon said in closing. “But we can’t go back to the way things were before Oct. 7 - we must be unified as one family. We can have different opinions, but we must love each other.” share in social medias: Previous Update Next Update More Updates Where does Israel go from here?

Since the outbreak of the war, approximately 3,000 Haredim have voluntarily applied to enlist in the IDF, and around 450 Haredim over the age of 26 have joined as reservists. Additionally, Haredim are actively involved in vital work with organizations like United Hatzalah and ZAKA, showcasing their commitment to serving their communities in times of crisis.

Graduating from the Battle Field When the student couldn't come to campus, campus went to the student!  Read more Student takes Bachelor's Degree Final Exam on the Front Lines David Ankori, a JCT student was conscripted on Simchat Torah, with just one exam left to complete his computer science studies. “I was supposed to take my last exam in July, but I was called up for reserve duty, and a special date was set for me after Succot,” Ankori recounts. “When I was called up on October 7, I was a bit stressed about what would happen to my degree and professional progress. I was worried that everything would be postponed after the war, and then I'd have to retake the course,” he recalled. Yair Goldstein, his lecturer at JCT, refused to accept the situation as it stood. “David had found a job in high tech, and the lack of eligibility for his degree could delay his starting work. Since the exam covers theoretical parts summarizing various subjects learned throughout the degree, there was an option to conduct it orally.” Goldstein informed Ankori that if he couldn't make it to the exam, the exam would come to him. “We agreed to meet somewhere in the field, and meanwhile I studied for the exam using my smartphone between shifts,” Ankori explains. Goldstein, who himself was called up on reserve duty and currently serves in Judea and Samaria, used a vacation day to compose a special exam paper for Ankori. “I printed it, put it in a folder, and headed to the base,” he says. Goldstein administered the exam and, on its conclusion, informed Ankori that he had passed it successfully. “Yair was amazing,” Ankori says excitedly. “He doesn't compromise in terms of the academic level and obligations, but on the other hand, he always finds a way to accommodate the students.” At JCT, Ankori's story is not an isolated case. When the war broke out, a comprehensive effort was undertaken by the center's administration, led by the Rector, Prof. Dan Buchnik, in collaboration with faculty and department heads, to make accommodation for conscripts and those affected by the war. Moreover, it was decided that academic staff would serve as mentors to assist students and for first-year students, instructional and teaching videos were created. Additionally, a group of outstanding students will help the freshmen start the academic year, which is expected to commence on December 24. “The academic year was supposed to start almost two months ago, but due to the situation, many students, a significant number of whom are conscripted for combat, are in uncertainty,” notes Prof. Buchnik. “Accordingly, we constructed a plan for economic, emotional and academic benefits that incorporates the academic and professional requirements with the challenges the war has created for the students.” share in social medias: Previous Update Next Update More Updates Where does Israel go from here?

Schreiber LevTech Updates JCT students and alumni develop solutions to protect Israel on home and cyber fronts At the outbreak of the war, JCT's Schreiber Lev Tech Entrepreneurship Center and its Take Action program, called on students and alumni to come up with solutions for better practices in an emergency situation. On the civil front, JCT graduate Rami Triestman, has created a web-based solution enabling civil defense units to communicate with each other during emergencies if internet service is down. This solution operates via telephone rather than cellular network, and consequently is not dependent on internet connectivity. It enables voice messages to be transmitted to alert civil defense units in times of emergency, even if traditional internet services are malfunctioning. Meanwhile, with the internet inundated with anti-semetic content, many Jewish advocates have felt frustrated in their inability to respond to such harmful rhetoric in an efficient manner. During this year's JCT hackathon, students, Ido Schwartz, Ori Kessler and Eliya Livshitz, came up with an idea that went on to win first place at a national Hackathon to find technological solutions to help Holocaust survivors and the challenges of Holocaust education and remembrance. They created Savee, a tool using generative AI technology, which the students have now further developed to counter anti-Israel and anti-Semetic sentiments online. Savee reviews the written content and concurrently gathers verified information from an established online database. It then generates a precise, fact-based response to refute the content. To date, Savee has responded to 700 posts per day, reaching 7.3 million users in order to combat antisemitism, Jew-hatred, and Holocaust denial content on social media. This past week, 15 JCT students together with students from other Jerusalem academic institutions took part in a hackathon organized by the Jerusalem high-tech community, venture capital funds, and entrepreneurs under the auspices of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. The aim of the hackathon was to enhance Israel’s PR efforts across a variety of digital platforms. The innovations of JCT students, who participated through the Schreiber Lev Tech Entrepreneurship Center, attracted considerable attention and are now moving forward with their development. These included: * A tool to identify copyright violations and thus remove misleading social media posts, that use photos and videos taken from unrelated past events worldwide, to discredit Israel. Failure to remove these posts might result in legal action against the social network for their involvement. * An engine to help measure whether an information campaign is effective and whether the Israeli message resonates on social networks. * A tool to challenge Tiktok, that removes a lot of pro-Israeli content on the grounds that the advertising rules were violated. This tool shows whether a video complies with the rules of publication so as to be able to challenge false accusations. It will also find videos that are not compliant and request they be removed. share in social medias: Previous Update Next Update More Updates Where does Israel go from here?

JCT leverages support group for Orthodox nurses to fortify Israeli hospitals Home Page News and Updates ... nurses What started out as a WhatsApp support group for ultra-Orthodox nurses has transformed into a volunteer hub of 1,400 men and women eager to help the 4,500 wounded men, women and children hospitalized across the nation. Nov 2023 What started out as a WhatsApp support group for ultra-Orthodox nurses has transformed into a volunteer hub of 1,400 men and women eager to help the 4,500 wounded men, women and children hospitalized across the nation. Kol Israel Nurses Association (KIN) was set up last year by faculty members of Jerusalem College of Technology's (JCT) Selma Jelinek School of Nursing Dr. Hila Videl, Netanel Foxbrumer and Avi Kirshberg, to help coordinate opportunities for students and graduates to spring into action in order to reinforce the country's strained health care system. Most of the volunteers are students and graduates from JCT's nursing school. The initiative continues JCT's decades-long contribution to the State of Israel. Hundreds of JCT students were drafted by the IDF, including 75 percent of JCT's male nursing students. Many others are aiding the war effort in hospitals and through volunteering with Magen David Adom and United Hatzalah. The effort is largely focused on getting volunteers where they are needed and on providing Emergency Nursing Refresher Courses for those medical professionals who have not handled trauma or shock patients in years. \"On the very first day of the war, we quickly mobilized numerous volunteers to support medical centers. This became crucial as many healthcare workers were unable to work due to the loss of family members and friends, coupled with the shock of the situation. Organizing this volunteer effort played a significant role in addressing this crisis,\" explained Dr. Videl. \"Many of our students have already been called up for reserves,\" Dr. Ahuva Spitz, head of JCT's Selma Jelinek School of Nursing, added. \"Some students volunteer with emergency response organizations and many others volunteer in hospitals across the country.\" The duration of the volunteer work differs based on one's availability, Dr. Spitz explained, with some students volunteering a couple shifts a week and others working at hospitals around the clock. \"The resilience on the home front and the sheer volume of volunteers who have stepped up to the plate to help has been tremendous,\" she said. JCT has charged staff members with working closely with a Health Ministry hotline, where volunteers are needed the most. JCT then dispatches its students nationally, based on need. share in social medias: Previous Update Next Update More Updates Where does Israel go from here?

Zvika Mor, the father of one of the Israelis kidnapped in Gaza, mourned Hamas' death grip on the region in a massive prayer vigil hosted by The Jerusalem College of Technology on Thursday. Speaking to the audience, he said, \"We have not only 240 kidnapped Israelis, but 8 million kidnapped by Hamas who decides when all of us will be able to sleep peacefully at night. We need to be free people in our country – a country that should be free of shelters, weapons, border fences and an Iron Dome. It's noble to die for our country, yes, but now is the time for our enemy to die for our country.\" The prayer and solidarity vigil held at The Jerusalem College of Technology was intended to pray for the safe return of the hostages and IDF soldiers, swift recovery for those injured, and for the ascent of the souls of those murdered by Hamas. Attending the vigil were representatives of families of the hostages, hundreds of JCT students and Stuart Hershkowitz, former vice president of the school, who read the Daf Yomi.

Israel At War - A JCT Update Home Page News and Updates ... war 1 newsletter oct 2023 Oct 15, 2023 Israel at War - A JCT Update Dear Friends, The traditional Simchat Torah refrain שישו ושמחו בשמחת תורה invites us to “rejoice and be happy with the Torah.” This year, our celebrations were shattered. Our young men and women were recalled to the military and joy turned to fear and as reports continued to come in, our fear turned to sheer horror. The numbers are staggering, and one can hardly fight back tears realizing that every number is a name, and every name has a family. Right now, we are all one very broken family. JCT’s core legacy of Religious Zionism remains who we are. During the Yom Kippur War in 1973, JCT lost students and tragically, additional students and faculty have since fallen while serving our nation. Many of our staff and students are now in activated, reserve combat units. Fully, 75 percent of our men nursing students have been recalled to the Israel Defense Force on emergency draft orders. As we pray to Hashem for the welfare of our military forces, for the welfare and speedy return of our kidnapped brothers and sisters and the speedy and full recovery of the thousands wounded, we are taking action. * JCT will continue to be guided by the IDF Home Front Command and adhere to their instructions. * The administration has postponed the start of our Fall semester, which was to begin this coming Sunday. It is currently rescheduled to begin on October 22. * Students are collecting basic necessities and preparing food for soldiers and families in the South, donating blood, and cleaning out bomb shelters. Morale is high. * JCT has offered residents of the South the use of dormitory buildings on our Lev Campus, providing a chance for a respite from the tension and fear. * JCT is providing a wide range of academic adjustments and support services to meet the needs of our students who themselves (or their spouses) have been called for reserve duty. * Finally, we are assisting the families of the draftees. Rabbi Yehoshua Weitzman, sharing one of the teachings of Rav Kook, coined the expression עם הנצח לא מפחד מדרך ארוכה - “ The Nation of Eternity fears not the long journey”. For millennia, our enemies have pursued us, and persecuted us, and by the grace of Hashem we prevailed. Now too, with Hashem’s help, we will prevail. In our next update, we hope to share good news – stories of courage, bravery and victory. ' קוה אל ה' חזק ויאמץ לבך וקוה אל ה _Look to Hashem, be strong and of good courage!

The Jerusalem College of Technology Opens All Its Engineering Degree Tracks to English Speakers Home Page News and Updates ... The Jerusalem College of Technology Opens All Its Engineering Degree Tracks to English Speakers Students will begin with a year of Hebrew study (Ulpan) combined with Computer Science courses, which will then enable native English speakers to pursue engineering degrees taught in Hebrew. September 2023 The Jerusalem College of Technology announced it has opened access for native English speakers to its illustrious engineering degrees. This new model will enroll English speakers in a new track of the JCT International Program. That track will start with a year of Ulpan (Hebrew language courses) and computer science and math courses taught in English. Following that year, students will have the option to continue studying Computer Science fully in English or to transition to other engineering majors, taught in Hebrew. JCT offers engineering degrees in software, industrial, electrical, and electro-optical engineering. In addition, the one-year track in JCT’s International Program will qualify students to enter JCT’s highly regarded Bioinformatics program. This new option will be introduced in the fall of 2024 and will enable students to obtain a wide range of engineering degrees at JCT (the only religious engineering college in Israel). The first year of the program will include those courses most often taken by new engineering or computer science students including calculus, linear algebra, and others. They will be coupled with a rigorous Ulpan that will teach Hebrew language, including the professional vocabulary that is essential to studying engineering in Hebrew. Prof. Abba Engelberg, the academic dean of the International Program, stressed that the Hebrew language training is a unique aspect of the program and it can open doors to the full gamut of engineering courses offered at the school. “We want to prepare our students for life in Israel and that includes having a strong knowledge of the language” he said. “The program’s built-in ulpan, gives students the option to choose from a plethora of engineering classes offered on campus after they have a good grasp of Hebrew. Potentially, after their first year, they can integrate into degree tracks like electro-optical engineering, electrical engineering, software engineering and many more, alongside native-born Israelis.” The new track is a direct response to the popular demand for engineering studies in Jewish communities around the world as the next generation of students are increasingly interested in obtaining degrees in practical areas of study that will yield high-level income upon graduation. Mo re than 90% of JCT’s alumni are employed in their field within a year of graduation. JCT graduates enter the workforce in leading firms such as Intel, Google, Microsoft, Amdocs, Rafael, Elbit, Check Point, Texas Instruments, and IBM. “Students from across the globe want to study engineering and computer science because those are considered prestigious areas of study. Our International Program has grown by over 25 percent this past year and the more disciplines that we offer, the more students can realize their dream of earning their degrees in Israel,” explained Rabbi Shlomo Anapolle, Director of JCT’s International Program. Rabbi Anapolle added, “Prof. Zev Lev’s founding vision for JCT was that it would educate students to synthesize their profession with Torah learning, while also developing Israel's hi-tech industry and producing Jewish leaders who are dedicated to the country. This program does just that.\" He continued, “The vision of JCT is to drive change throughout the country and across the globe. This launch furthers JCT’s reach and expands our ability to have our students realize their academic and professional goals.” JCT’s students hail from 38 countries around the world. Approximately 70% of the international students come from North America. The College’s student body has the highest percentage of new immigrants (6%) of any higher education institution in the country. share in social medias: Previous Update Next Update More Updates Where does Israel go from here?

Haredi integration should be encouraged, not questioned Home Page News and Updates ... Haredi integration should be encouraged, not questioned The Central Bureau of Statistics reports an all-time high in employment among haredi men at 55.8% – surpassing last quarter’s record-breaking 55%. September 2023 In statistical analysis, it is often believed that numbers and data provide unequivocal truth. However, the relationship between haredi employment rates and public opinion in Israel illustrates a more complex scenario.During periods of stagnation in the employment rates of haredi men, many journalists, commentators, and public figures readily accepted the data at face value. Yet, as the tide turns, with the employment rate among haredi men rising alongside a sharp increase in haredi academic degree recipients, the numbers no longer align with certain narratives that are critical of the haredi community. As a result, these figures are disregarded or denied. The adage “you can’t argue with numbers” presumes that empirical evidence is compelling. This assumption is increasingly challenged by those who selectively utilize or dismiss data to bolster preexisting arguments and agendas. The recent report by the Council for Higher Education, detailing a 25% rise in haredi undergraduate students nationwide and a 45% increase in advanced degrees, adds further complexity to the dialogue. Moreover, the Central Bureau of Statistics reports an all-time high in employment among haredi men at 55.8% – surpassing last quarter’s record-breaking 55%. These statistics should be cause for celebration, yet reactions remain polarized. Some individuals are unmoved by this data. The same metrics that were once embraced are now rejected or ignored. Responses range from outright denial to shifting the discourse toward military recruitment or the importance of STEM (science, technology, engineering, mathematics) education. Certain arguments contend that haredi engagement with academia and employment is merely a reactive necessity, not an active choice or the product of dedicated efforts by the state, academic institutions, or other organizations. These arguments often extend the discussion into topics such as gender-separated studies and STEM requirements, reflecting an overly simplistic approach to the complexities of haredi society. My extensive personal experience in promoting haredi integration into academia and employment tells a more nuanced story, where coercive measures imposed on the haredi community tend to foster isolation rather than constructive engagement. Segregated education receives judicial support Moreover, the contentious battle over gender-separated education has resulted in judicial recognition of its importance, and indeed the vast majority of haredim enrolled in higher education study in such frameworks. But it is impossible to ignore the considerable harm caused by the offensive and harsh discourse against the haredi public, and by curbing the development of new programs and frameworks for integrating haredim into academia. Forecasts suggest that Israel’s GDP loss due to low haredi employment could reach NIS 220 billion ($58 billion) by 2050. In the face of such figures, we must not only acknowledge the success highlighted by the Council for Higher Education but also maintain a critical perspective. We must continue to guide haredi students toward high-quality education leading to professions that are lucrative and in high-demand, such as engineering, computer science, and hi-tech. According to the published data, the number of undergraduate degree recipients in these professions increased 20% – but the rate of haredim in these professions is still too low and it is necessary to continue to direct resources and efforts in this direction. Finally, we must not belittle or underestimate the importance of long-term planning toward haredi integration, which is now bearing fruit. Now more than ever, the state, the academic community, and the public must support these initiatives and focus on the steps required to bring about the continuation of this positive trend. Success will not be achieved through coercion, but rather through recognizing the need to respect the choices, beliefs, and lifestyles of haredim. share in social medias: Previous Update Next Update More Updates Where does Israel go from here?

Potential outcomes of a nuclear bomb strike on Israel Home Page News and Updates ... Judgement day? Potential outcomes of a nuclear bomb strike on Israel We recently marked the 78th anniversary of the atomic bombings on Japan during World War II, and the looming specter of nuclear threats continues to cast its shadow September 2023 Dr. Yehoshua Socol, who specializes in nuclear physics, challenges a commonly held assumption, asserting that while a nuclear attack on Israel would undoubtedly bring devastation, contrary to prevailing beliefs, it would not spell the end of the Zionist enterprise  “Socol suggests that the consequences of a nuclear strike would parallel those of a direct missile attack, with casualties limited to those in close proximity to the blast.” This year marks the passage of 78 years since the fateful events of August 1945 when atomic bombs struck Hiroshima and Nagasaki. The occasion gained renewed attention with the release of director Christopher Nolan's film “Oppenheimer,” a biographical exploration of Robert Oppenheimer, often dubbed the “father” of the atomic bomb. In the backdrop of ongoing negotiations for a new nuclear agreement between Iran and the United States, coupled with resurgent Russian nuclear threats, the specter of nuclear catastrophe continues to haunt our world in 2023. Dr. Yehoshua Socol, a scholar and lecturer at JCT - Lev Academic Center, an authority on nuclear physics and chairman of the Nuclear Awareness Academics Forum, engages in a discourse with \"Israel Hayom\" newspaper, contending that even in an extreme scenario where Iran procures nuclear capabilities and targets Tel Aviv with an atomic bomb, the outcome would be catastrophic but not apocalyptic. “Such an extreme case will undoubtedly have disastrous consequences on an unprecedented scale,” asserts Dr. Socol. “Yet, this would not signal the demise of the nation. While tens of thousands may perish, and widespread destruction would ensue, it is not tantamount to a second Holocaust. Israel’s existence as a political entity would endure, and the map would not be purged of Gush Dan.” Dr. Socol draws upon research delving into the potential nuclear threat to Israel, noting that analyzing the consequences of the use of nuclear weapons in Japan at the end of World War II indicates that most people who saw the nuclear mushroom cloud in person survived the ordeal, often unscathed. He highlights the case of Hiroshima, where individuals sheltered within concrete buildings just 200 meters from the blast site managed to survive. Conversely, most individuals situated in open spaces within a 2 kilometers radius perished. Over the years, radiation-induced fatal cancer affected around 600 survivors of the atomic blasts, resulting in an overall excess mortality rate of merely 6%. Furthermore, contrary to prevalent notions, no hereditary mutations manifested in the survivors’ descendants. Dr. Socol underscores that those in close proximity to the explosion would face a similar fate to a direct missile impact. He outlines behavioral guidelines that could potentially amplify survival chances by a factor of ten in the event of a nuclear strike. \"Anticipate the blast wave as the primary source of injury. React by seeking cover on the ground upon sighting the initial flash.” Dr. Socol’s insights also encompass the effectiveness of underground shelters. Such refuges, he posits, could shield individuals located at least 200 meters away from a blast of comparable intensity to the Hiroshima bomb. Standard bomb shelters might offer protection at a distance of approximately 500 meters from the explosion. For thermal radiation generated by a nuclear blast, rudimentary safeguards like clothing or a newspaper sheet could mitigate skin scorching. Radiation aftermath also enters the discourse. Dr. Socol clarifies that immediate death is not a certainty for those exposed to high radiation levels. Many can be saved through antibiotic and anti-emetic treatments. Even those who survive radiation sickness face only a 50% elevated risk of developing cancer, resulting in a marginal reduction in life expectancy from 81 years to around 79 years. Worries of genetic mutations, he contends, are unfounded. Addressing nuclear fallout, Dr. Socol explains its potential generation in a near-ground explosion. He notes that Hiroshima and Nagasaki did not witness this phenomenon. Fallout radiation diminishes tenfold within seven hours and 100-fold within two days. He advises seeking refuge in subterranean or multi-story buildings, avoiding ground and upper floors when necessary. In conclusion, Dr. Socol emphasizes that while a nuclear bomb wields devastating power, its scope is confined. Structures within a 400-meter radius of the blast epicenter might crumble, while modern buildings crafted from reinforced concrete could collapse at a kilometer’s distance.  Stone and concrete edifices with an inset floor may falter a mile and a half away. Severe skin burns could afflict individuals three kilometers out, and unreinforced windows would shatter at four kilometers. These findings affirm that the nation’s survival won’t be compromised, echoing the sentiment that “the Glory of Israel does not deceive or change His mind” is a belief reinforced by scientific analysis.

Deputy Finance Min.: 'Academic institutions have been robbed of freedom of speech' Home Page News and Updates ... Deputy Finance Min.: 'Academic institutions have been robbed of freedom of speech' In a visit to the Jerusalem College of Technology’s Tal Campus, MK Michal Woldiger praises the school amid the backdrop of academic institutions that have engaged in divisive politics. August 2023 There’s a dearth of freedom of speech in academic institutions, Deputy Finance Minister Michal Woldiger (Religious Zionism) asserted during a visit to the Jerusalem College of Technology’s (JCT) Tal Campus for women last week. “Unfortunately, as of late, we’re seeing less freedom of speech, and it’s impossible for people to share their honest opinions in many academic institutions,” MK Woldiger of the Religious Zionist Party said. “However, here at the Jerusalem College of Technology, democracy exists, and everyone is free to respectfully express themselves equally.” “This is the way of the Torah, and this is also the philosophy of JCT as an institution that combines holy and secular studies and excels at doing both. I’m thrilled to see so many young women come to study at an institution that prioritizes uncompromising professionalism together with studying sacred texts.” Woldiger’s remarks come amid Israeli academia’s opposition to judicial reforms. Many Israeli colleges and universities issued a joint statement warning that should the judicial reforms pass, they will negatively impact Israel’s higher education. Last week, thousands of female students kicked off the academic year at JCT’s Tal Campus for women. Currently, the Tal Campus accommodates more than 2,100 women. The school recently broke ground on the campus’ new location which is slated for completion in 2025. The new campus will be the permanent home of academic excellence for up to 5,000 female students in nursing, computer science, industrial engineering, accounting, and management. According to Israel’s Central Bureau of Statistics, in 2022, women represented only 28% of employees with core technological jobs in the hi-tech workforce. Per the Israel Innovation Authority, last year, nationally, women comprised only 30% of all students studying tech-related courses. At JCT, over half (53%) of the students studying computer science are women. Although most higher education institutions in Israel begin the year in the middle of October, the Jerusalem College of Technology began its studies - as they do every year - in the beginning of the Hebrew month of Elul. \"Many high-tech professions are perceived as largely dominated by men. JCT is the only academic institution in Israel shattering the glass ceiling by training women in high-tech professions,\" noted Etti Stern, Head of the Tal Campus, \"I am deeply pleased to inaugurate another academic year. I wish our new students great success. They will join thousands of our graduates who have gone on to obtain significant and high-earning roles in Israel’s hi-tech scene.” Over 90% of JCT’s alumni are employed in their field within a year of graduation.

However students should check with specific colleges as each has different requirements for transfer credits. Questions? In Memoriam:  Robert M. Beren O.B.M. Home Page News and Updates ... In Memoriam:  Robert M. Beren O.B.M. It is  with deep sadness  that  the Jerusalem College of  Technology (JCT) mourns the passing of our long-standing  friend Robert M. Beren O.B.M. August 2023 On behalf of  the Board of Trustees, administration,  faculty, students and alumni,  we wish to extend our heartfelt condolences to his children, Nancy, Amy, Julie, and Adam, to his sister Lela Beren Jacoby, and their families. Mr. Beren’s philanthropic passion has strengthened the Jewish world immensely.  A  visionary and inspiring leader, Mr. Beren embodied leading by example. His boundless commitment  to higher education has benefitted among others,  the Jerusalem College of  Technology, Harvard and Yeshiva University. His support extended to other religious and educational institutions and to important social institutions in Israel and America in his role as President of the Robert M. Beren Foundation. The Beren family’s history in the United States began in the early  1900s  in  Marietta,  Ohio, where  Robert grew up after his family moved from Latvia at the turn of the century. His father and two uncles started the family oil business after the discovery of oil in the United States in nearby Titusville, Pennsylvania. Robert and his brother Sheldon O.B.M. carried on the family business when they moved to Wichita, Kansas, in the 1950s, and then Robert went on to build his own company, Berexco, which became one of the largest family-owned businesses in the mid-continent region of the United States. Mr. Robert Beren served with distinction as a soldier in the U.S. Army during World War II, showcasing his dedication and sense of duty. Mr. Beren’s own educational journey exemplifies his love for academic challenges. After graduating cum laude from Harvard College with a B.A. in Economics, he continued his academic pursuits and graduated with high distinction from Harvard’s Graduate School of Business Administration. His academic training, military experience, business acumen, and stellar personal qualities were all instrumental in his phenomenal success. Mr. Beren was a stalwart supporter of JCT for over 25 years. As  the sole  trustee of  the Israel Henry Beren Charitable Foundation,  he endowed many projects in memory of his uncle, Israel Henry Beren O.B.M. Dedicated in 1997,  the entryway plaque  to  the Israel Henry Beren Institute of Science and Torah describes Israel Henry Beren as one, “who enabled others to learn the treasures of the Torah and was himself an example of the righteous values in its teaching.” To meet JCT’s growing needs,  the Foundation funded the expansion of that building in 2000 and again in 2017. Robert  Beren continued his generous support for  JCT  by building the Israel Henry Beren Dormitory Pavilion in 2002, the Israel Henry Beren Center for  Academic Preparatory Studies in 2013, and opened the Israel Henry Beren Exercise Center in 2016. Mr. Beren’s most recent and most significant contribution to JCT was the naming of the Beren Center for Engineering on the future Tal  Campus for women. This four-story building will house engineering and computer science departments, along with the Beren Entrepreneurship Center and the Beren Midrasha. The Beren Center for Engineering will play a major role in training women entering the Israeli scientific and computer science workforce for many decades to come. Mr. Beren’s immeasurable impact on the global  Jewish community will resonate for generations. Though we mourn the loss of a great individual, his philanthropic contributions will stand as an enduring tribute to his memory. share in social medias: Previous Update Next Update More Updates Where does Israel go from here?

New Medical School Preparatory Program Opens Doors for Haredi Students Jerusalem College of Technology and Netzach Educational Network launch medical school preparatory program for haredi students. August 2023 August 2023 JCT, together with the Netzach Educational Network, on Monday, launched a new mechina (preparatory program) for haredi men and women who are seeking to become physicians. The new Netzach Medical Mechina offers separate courses for men and women. The program is designed for students who already have a bachelor’s degree, with classes twice a week for six-hour sessions for three semesters over 15 months, with additional online units for independent study. The goal is to prepare students for success in the entrance examinations at Israel’s medical schools. The program is being led by Dr. Sara Genut, head of the JCT Bioinformatics Department, who has extensive experience preparing students for medical school. Israeli Minister of Health Moshe Arbel (Shas) said, “Establishing a haredi preparatory program for medical school is a great blessing, which will enable the integration of haredi students in the world of medicine and, in doing so, help them look ahead to the future, for the benefit of the entire healthcare system.” “Thanks to the high level of education found in the Jerusalem College of Technology, a school that has successfully integrated different populations who aspire to excellence, we will be able to see in the coming years young doctors from all walks of life taking their place at the forefront of hospitals and medical centers across the country,” he added. The new pre-medical preparatory program will equip ambitious and talented haredi students to enter the medical profession, which will be an added benefit for their own community and Israel’s society at large. The program is designed to support and empower haredi students, particularly women, some of whom already have children. It will include workshops on cultural competence, in preparation for entering a profession that serves people from different cultures. It will also cover issues of halakha (Jewish law) and medical ethics. As part of the program, those who are accepted to medical school after the course will be supported throughout their medical studies by haredi physicians as their mentors. A total of 40 candidates have been accepted to the program, out of 150 applicants. To be accepted, they demonstrated the high aptitude levels required for success in medical school, as well as a recognized bachelor's degree in a relevant scientific subject or in nursing, physical therapy, or occupational therapy. Partial scholarships were offered to qualified students. Obtaining a medical degree is a challenging goal for most Israeli students, but this is especially true for haredim for a variety of reasons, including the intensity of the academic studies required to enter medical schools in the country, various cultural differences in many haredi communities, and the low standard for science and math education in most haredi schools. As a result, most medically-oriented haredi students have opted to enter nursing and para-medical professions, as well as other science and technology roles, but have often been met with a glass ceiling when trying to enter Israel’s highly competitive medical schools. President of JCT, Prof. Chaim Sukenik said, “Medicine remains one of the most sought-after professions in Israel. Opening the door to this world for the haredi population will allow many talented young people in that community to realize this dream. This will not only train much-needed medical personnel but will further integrate haredi society into the healthcare community. The Jerusalem College of Technology is pleased to play an important role in creating this program.” “We have consulted many experts during the process of designing this unique course. Its curriculum will prepare young men and women from haredi backgrounds for the academic and cultural challenges involved in becoming doctors,” Michoel Nechtiler, Netzach CEO, said. “We recognize that there are many obstacles for them to overcome, and we are committed to supporting them in maintaining their haredi lifestyle and Torah observance throughout the process. We hope that this flagship program will open the doors to Israel’s medical profession and encourage younger haredi students to strive for excellence in their studies and to aim for the top.” President of Shaare Zedek Medical Center Prof. Yonatan Halevy, who is also Chairman of the Board of the Netzach Educational Network, said: “There are no shortcuts to being admitted to medical school in Israel. Our standards are very high, and so too is our level of education in this field. This Netzach preparatory program is a rich one and is structured in a way that it will provide the very best training, enabling haredi students to successfully integrate into the country’s medical schools.” share in social medias: Previous Update Next Update More Updates Where does Israel go from here?

Israeli students come up with emergency sensor for Parkinson's patients Home Page News and Updates ... Israeli students come up with emergency sensor for Parkinson's patients The team participated in the Jerusalem College of Technology's sixth annual \"Hack.Her.It\" event, which saw some 150 female contestants tasked with coming up with solutions to complex technological challenges posed by hi-tech giants. August 2023 August 2023 Oriya Demlich spent the past few years watching her beloved grandfather suffer from Parkinson's Disease and witnessed it slowly erode his independence. After his death, Demlich enrolled in the Tal Campus for Women at the Jerusalem College of Technology to earn a Bioinformatics degree. Last month, her late grandfather served as a source of inspiration when she participated in the school's hackathon where she and her teammates decided to come up with a mechanism with life-saving implications for those with the disease. The team participated in JCT's sixth annual \"Hack.Her.It\" event organized by the school's Schreiber LevTech Entrepreneurship Center. Some 150 students from the women's campuses participated in the event where they were tasked with coming up with solutions to complex technological challenges posed to them by hi-tech companies including Rafael, Intel, Elbit, Amazon, and more. \"The Schreiber LevTech Entrepreneurship Center offers a range of programs for students to gain valuable experience in the real world of entrepreneurship, innovation, and product creation on campus. \"Students work under the guidance of professional business and tech mentors in hackathons, workshops, and pre-accelerator and accelerator programs\", explains Orlee Guttman, co-founder of the center. \"These tools and experience are crucial to their futures as entrepreneurs or intrapreneurs\". The center dovetails with the school's overall mission to provide a rigorous curriculum focusing on engineering, health sciences, and business degrees to some 5,000 students from Israel and 38 countries around the world. The school offers a dual curriculum, combining Jewish studies and academia, and consists of students from the Orthodox and ultra-Orthodox sectors. As for Demlich, her team, which was composed of other bioinformatics and engineering students, worked on the \"WalkSafe Challenge\" (named after the company of the same name) and developed an emergency sensor for walkers used by Parkinson's patients. Their solution garnered so much positive attention from the judges that they made it to the final stage of the competition. More than 10 million people suffer from Parkinson's worldwide, with 35,000 of them living in Israel. The disease arises from a neurological dopamine deficiency which causes many motor problems such as uncontrollable tremors, stiff joints, a condition called \"Freezing of Gait\" where the knee is immobile which severely inhibits one's ability to walk properly. Freezing of Gait is particularly dangerous for those with Parkinson's who need the assistance of a walker to move because the upper body continues to propel forward while the other half is stationary leading to the possibility of falling that could cause a life-threatening head injury. \"A person with Parkinson's doesn't have the same reaction time as the average person if they fall, so they need a companion who can monitor them when muscle locking occurs in order to prevent a fall,\" Demlich explained. As such, the team developed an innovative sensor that is based on artificial intelligence that notifies the patient to put the brake on their walkers without external assistance. The device is operated by an app that is accessible on smartphones and uses data to monitor the motion of the walker. \"The app measures the distance between the walker and the person, based on data that is cross-referenced from both sources,\" a representative from the WalkSafe explained. The sensor is designed to detect when a person is still pushing the walker even though their feet have remained frozen in place. In which case, the person can fall if the walker is not stopped. As a result, the sensor beeps and alerts the patient that he must use the handbrake and thus prevent falling. \"Our app helps Parkinson's patients not only physically through notifying them of potential dangers, but the device helps psychologically as well, as it gives them a renewed sense of independence,\" Demlich said. The students will continue to fine-tune their idea and are aiming to create a walker with a device built in to enable the walker to brake automatically if it senses the patient is too far away from it. They are also exploring the possibility of collaborating with other companies who would be able to install the sensor they developed on other similar products like a baby stroller. share in social medias: Previous Update Next Update More Updates Where does Israel go from here?

OU-JLIC launches at Jerusalem College of Technology, strengthening its international English-speaking program Home Page News and Updates ... OU-JLIC launches at Jerusalem College of Technology, strengthening its international English-speaking program The program, which has grown by 25% annually, will be bolstered by the OU-JLIC couple providing students support, social services and a home-away-from-home. July 2023 The natural partnership between the Jerusalem College of Technology (JCT) and the Orthodox Union’s Jewish Learning Initiative on Campus (JLIC) program demonstrates that JCT is the appropriate home for Orthodox students from abroad studying in Israel. Extending JCT’s excellence beyond the classroom, the JCT-JLIC partnership will ensure students enjoy a home-away-from-home in the heart of Jerusalem by building a robust social life on campus. This marks the first time that the program is being offered in Jerusalem. Rabbi and Rebbetzin Simcha and Margalit Herschman will be the inaugural JCT-JLIC couple tasked with launching the program. The couple made aliyah from Chicago and West Hempstead, N.Y., respectively, and met at a JLIC event. They are now eager to build the sense of community for international students that brought them together. “Our experience with JLIC was life-changing. We saw JLIC build community and unify olim , and it was instrumental in helping us feel like we were at home,” the Herschmans said in a joint statement. “We are now eager to do that for others. It’s so important to feel a sense of belonging when you’re far away from family and that’s why we’re looking forward to building relationships with students, inviting them into our home, and helping them build a strong and supportive community.” Since 2001, the OU-JLIC has helped students observe key aspects of Jewish life across 32 campuses in the United States, Canada and Israel. On those campuses, creating Jewish learning and social opportunities as well as Shabbat and holiday programming are components of what OU-JLIC provides. Given that Jewish learning and programming are core components of JCT student life, the OU-JLIC couple will focus on building community and social programming for students on both the Lev Campus for men and the Tal Campus for women. “This partnership will provide a warm home away from home for our international students,” said Rabbi Shlomo Anapolle, director of JCT’s International Program, taught in English. “In my recruiting efforts in North America, I’m frequently asked if JCT has an OU-JLIC program and I’m delighted that we can finally say yes. The OU’s choice to prioritize our school further demonstrates JCT’s integral role as an excellent choice for students who come to Israel seeking a religious, affordable academic environment in Israel. Our alumni are immediately sought after as leaders in high-tech and health sciences. We’re proud of our winning model.” “Parents who send their children to the Jerusalem College of Technology can now rest easy knowing that there’s a dedicated couple looking out for their child’s spiritual and physical well-being on campus,” the rabbi added. JCT’s students hail from 38 countries from around the world. Approximately 70% of the international students come from North America. The college’s student body has the highest percentage of new immigrants (6%) of any higher education institution in the country. Home to approximately 5,000 students from different religious backgrounds, JCT is Jerusalem’s second-largest academic institution. The college’s vision is well-aligned with its home city of Jerusalem, helping to position the capital as a national hub for academic excellence in science, technology and other disciplines while maintaining religious tradition. share in social medias: Previous Update Next Update More Updates Where does Israel go from here?

Women’s Hackathon Produces Road Safety, Drone Detection Solutions Home Page News and Updates ... Women’s Hackathon Produces Road Safety, Drone Detection Solutions Road safety, traffic flow, and drone detection solutions took top prizes as a group of 150 students from JCT utilized the latest advances in artificial intelligence during the school’s sixth annual women’s hackathon at the Schreiber LevTech Entrepreneurship Center last week. June 2023 June 2023 During the 46-hour event, students from JCT’s women’s campuses who are pursuing degrees in software engineering, computer science, business administration, industrial engineering, and management tackled technological challenges presented by companies such as Rafael Advanced Systems, Intel, Elbit Systems, Amazon Web Services, Amdocs, and Shomrei HaDerech (Safe Lane). Many of the 150 religious students participating were young mothers who couldn’t leave their babies alone for an extended period. As such, the women wrote programming code while their infants were either on their laps or played in a specially organized nursery set up for the competition. This year’s hackathon marked the first time students used both classic AI and generative AI. “People are often initially scared of generative artificial intelligence, but it has quickly become an inseparable part of the technology and industry,” said Orlee Guttman, co-founder of the Schreiber LevTech Entrepreneurship Center. “Rather than looking at it as a threat, we see it as having tremendous potential, similar to the introduction of computers to math and science. Those who know how to use this tool most efficiently will lead the future. We need to allow our students to get hands-on experience as quickly as possible. Just as generative AI will now be an integral part of industry and science, it now has to be a part of academia and competitions, not as a shortcut but as a legitimate method to create technology,” Guttman said. AI’s applications in the competition were evident from the solution produced by the Healy team in response to a challenge presented by Amazon Web Services. The Healy team created a system that receives voice reports about a patient’s condition and directs emergency medical personnel to relevant treatment protocols and actions to prevent errors that may occur due to stress or forgetfulness. Using AI, the system learns the protocols and background information to the extent that it can guide the necessary steps during emergency events. And a generative AI-based system developed as part of the competition, DeMe, aims to assist in writing profiles for individuals using matchmaking websites and social networks, and for businesses. The top prize was awarded to the RoadEye team, which developed a more effective system to help prevent road accidents. The challenge was presented by Shomrei HaDerech/Safe Lane, a volunteer association that utilizes in-vehicle cameras to identify traffic violations. The students figured out how to obtain accurate images and information taken from the camera of a moving vehicle while the other vehicle committing the traffic violation is also moving and it could also capture images in low-light conditions. This team is the first to take on and succeed in that particular challenge, which SafeLane had also presented in past years. In second place was the RushHour team, which developed, in response to a challenge by Amazon Web Services, an intelligent system to alleviate traffic congestion. Using computer vision tools, the system utilizes existing cameras at intersections to determine the level of congestion and interacts with traffic lights to effectively ease congestion. The third-place team, Laser Hunter, in response to a challenge by Elbit Systems, developed technology to distinguish between friendly and enemy drones. They combined a laser system installed on the drone and a special algorithm developed by the students, which examines the received laser data and can classify who the drone belongs to. “From the moment we formed a team for the competition, it was clear to me that I would participate,” said Avital Horowitz, a second-year computer science student at JCT, who competed while caring for her six-month-old daughter. The baby accompanied her throughout the entire competition while her team developed a system for connecting buyers and sellers of second-hand products using a specially created Telegram bot. “Despite the challenging moments during the competition, with all the noise and fatigue, something was calming about having her with me. Despite the difficulties, she helped me stay focused,” Horowitz explained. “So, I decided to keep her with me until the end, even though my mother could have taken care of her. I was happy to have her on stage with me when we received the award for the best presentation in the competition.” The panel of expert judges for the competition included Yoni Colb, General Manager at Cross River; Liat Sverdlov, Investment Partner at OurCrowd; Ruthie Amaru, Chief Product Officer at Freightos; Ayo Oppenheimer Abitbol, VP of Development and Strategy at MassChallenge; and Aaron Zucker, Founder & Managing Partner at Sapir Venture Partners. The hackathon was sponsored by Cross River Bank, Fullstack Systems Ltd, the Women’s Amutot Initiative of the Greater Miami Jewish Federation, and the Jewish Women’s Fund of Atlanta. “The energy level was extremely high. Cross River and I are very proud to have sponsored the event and been able to take part. The hackathon reminded me why we at Cross River like recruiting JCT graduates. They are hard-working, smart, and innovative,” said Colb. share in social medias: Previous Update Next Update More Updates Where does Israel go from here?

Tal Campus hopes to help haredi women join male-dominated fields Home Page News and Updates ... Tal Campus hopes to help haredi women join male-dominated fields By providing access to cutting-edge resources and state-of-the-art facilities, the Tal Campus aims to give women the tools to excel in traditionally male-dominated fields. July 11 National statistics indicate 34% of women in tech-related fields. In contrast, at JCT 53% of computer science students are women out of 534 students. Lion explained that women from the Haredi (ultra-Orthodox) community have already found “JCT’s Tal Campus the perfect address for acquiring academic training.” A JCT degree will help religious women integrate into the city's labor market in high-income professions, Lion said, adding that he hoped the new campus would being young women from all over the country to Jerusalem thereby strengthening the city as the capital of Israel, “both socially and economically.” “The construction of this new campus is an important milestone in our efforts to integrate women in the fields of science and health,\" said JCT President Prof. Chaim Sukenik. He also emphasized the importance of the Tal Campus in promoting women's participation in the fields of science, health, management, and engineering. JCT explained that over 90% of its alumni find employment in their respective fields within a year of graduation. Graduates have secured positions in renowned companies such as Intel, Google, Microsoft, Amdocs, Rafael, Elbit, Check Point, Texas Instruments, and IBM. Uriel Ben-Nun, JCT's Deputy-CEO for Infrastructure, said he was grateful to Lion for his support and for his visit last week to their campus. \"I thank Mayor Moshe Lion… the Ministry of Jerusalem and Heritage, the Municipality of Jerusalem, and the Jerusalem Development Authority for their work promoting this project.

JCT aims to build largest college campus in Israel for religious women The new Tal Campus will house faculties to teach religious women business, engineering, science and more. JULY 11, 2023 JCT received its excavation permit on Sunday to build the new Tal Campus, which will be dedicated to empowering religious women to get jobs by expanding their education and career opportunities. “JCT is the leading Israeli institution of higher education providing academic training for religious women,” Jerusalem Mayor Moshe Lion said after his municipality granted the college its permit last week. Spanning an impressive 3.5 acres, the Tal Campus is projected to cost $120 million, with $70 million already raised by JCT. The campus will house several key facilities, including the Beren Center for Engineering, the Helmsley Center of Life and Health Sciences, the Friedman Center for Business and Management Studies, and the Tessler-Glina Cafeteria. On-campus housing and multiple outdoor spaces, including a beautifully landscaped garden, are also planned. The college expects construction to commence within the next six months. The new campus will serve as a home for approximately 3,000 students, offering expanded opportunities for religious women to pursue higher education and secure employment in a variety of sectors. share in social medias: Previous Update Next Update More Updates Where does Israel go from here?

Jerusalem mayor: 'School's secret to success is its special balance of holy and secular' Home Page News and Updates ... Jerusalem mayor: 'School's secret to success is its special balance of holy and secular Jerusalem Mayor Lion congratulates graduates of Jerusalem College of Technology Mechina Program: 'High quality academic degrees without abandoning the spirit found in the Beit Midrash.' July 5 2023 On July 5th, 130 men, who only thirteen months prior lacked high school level mathematics, English, and science, graduated from the Jerusalem College of Technology’s (JCT) Mechina, a pre-academic preparatory program, which qualified them to enter higher education. The Mechina provides classroom instruction, private tutoring, reinforcement courses, individual counseling, and mentorship opportunities to maximize the likelihood of each student’s success. “Over the years, the Jerusalem College of Technology has succeeded in providing many haredi youth with the tools to help them integrate into the workforce that will serve them and their families,” Jerusalem Mayor Moshe Lion said. “The school’s secret for success is its special combination of balancing the holy and secular. It is one of the oldest institutions in Jerusalem that offers high quality academic degrees without abandoning the spirit found in the Beit Midrash (the Torah study hall).” Lion stressed: “JCT serves as a stabilizing force for the city. It offers haredi men and women the chance to obtain a professional degree in a way that does not compromise their beliefs or their lifestyle and gives them a fantastic pathway to upward economic mobility.” Yonatan David Rosen, a Mechina graduate, said, “Those who want to succeed professionally must study math, physics, and English. I didn’t have the baseline of knowledge in those fields, especially in English. The program’s curriculum was a difficult one, but we received a great deal of help. Tutors assisted us with everything we needed — all we had to do was ask. Thank God, today I read English well, I am proud to have been accepted as a JCT student, and I am looking forward to earning a living as a software engineer.” “This Mechina program enables the academic success of these young men. Without it they would not qualify as students in higher education, which leads to high-paying jobs and careers,” noted JCT Vice President Daniel Fogel. He added, “It is a true source of pride watching students who begin degrees in computer science and engineering only a year after learning arithmetic.” “We are dedicated to integrating haredi men in the workforce, especially in high-tech professions,” Fogel said. “As such, we give them access to an esteemed team of lecturers, tutors and mentors who guide these students with patience. Alongside that, their study in our beit midrash (religious study hall) remains a central core of both who we are as an institution and their identity as religious men.” share in social medias: Previous Update Next Update More Updates Where does Israel go from here?

Canadian Friends Of JCT Chair Larry Krauss Awarded Honorary Fellowship Home Page News and Updates ... Canadian Friends Of JCT Chair Larry Krauss Awarded Honorary Fellowship Toronto Entrepreneur Major Supporter of Jerusalem College of Technology June 2023 JCT awarded an honorary fellowship to the outgoing Chairman of Canadian Friends of JCT (CFJCT) and major supporter of the College, visionary Toronto-based business leader Larry Krauss. He was recognized at a graduation ceremony on the Lev Campus on June 13. JCT honored Krauss — CEO and Principal of the Terracap Group of Companies, a Toronto-based group that owns, develops and operates high-quality real estate assets across North America — in recognition of his decades of service on the CFJCT board. Krauss announced he would step down from the board of CFJCT effective June 30. He has chaired CFJCT since 2011 and was previously a board member from the early 1990s. He is also a member of the Steering Committee for the new Tal Campus for women. Larry and his wife Sarah, on behalf of the Krauss Family Charitable Trust announced that the Trust would be making a seven-figure gift to the capital campaign for the future Tal Campus. The Tal Campus, a $120MM project, will be the new permanent home for thousands of JCT’s women students, which will provide them with increased opportunities to pursue higher education and attain quality employment in scientific and high-tech industries while remaining true to their religious identity. Long before his career in real estate and venture capital, Krauss studied biochemistry at the University of Toronto before earning his Juris Doctor and Masters of Law at Osgoode Hall Law School in Toronto. He also studied at JCT. Today, his support for the College brings his passions and experience full circle. The Terracap Group’s venture capital division, Terracap Ventures, has invested in more than 45 start-ups, including some which have been launched by JCT students. “It’s important for me that JCT educates students who would otherwise not have an exposure to advanced science”, said Krauss, citing as an example “those from the Haredi community — and enables them to become computer engineers, electro-optical engineers, and medical and other professionals who are able to advance the interests of the State of Israel and the well-being of their community, while still ensuring that their connection to Judaism and Torah continues to flourish. It has been tremendously fulfilling to serve as Chair of CFJCT and see so many students benefit from JCT’s mission. I am humbled to receive this honor from the College.” The June 13 ceremony featured 24 graduates of JCT’s Selma Jelinek School of Nursing, 17 accounting graduates, 23 business administration graduates and five master’s degree graduates. Krauss had attended JCT for approximately two months in 1970, the second year of the College’s existence. Having shortly before lost his father, Krauss decided to return home, to ultimately study at the University of Toronto. Though it was brief, Krauss felt his time as a JCT student was highly impactful as were his interactions with the College’s founder, and Israel Prize laureate, Prof. Ze’ev Lev. “Professor Lev stressed maintaining the highest-quality education in every discipline that the College offers — not just helping graduates get jobs, but promoting excellence, in both students and faculty. I am proud to see that vision thriving today and privileged to have been a part of it throughout its development.” Krauss added. After serving on the board for many years, Krauss was asked by Kurt Rothschild, OBM, to chair Canadian Friends of JCT. The organization has also posthumously honored Krauss’ grandparents Rabbi Eliezer and Chaya Weinberger, OBM, who both died in concentration camps during the Holocaust.

The Time to Incentivize Haredi Higher Education Has Arrived Home Page News and Updates ... The Time to Incentivize Haredi Higher Education Has Arrived The common refrain around Haredi employment in Israel goes like this. Haredi education does not teach science, technology, engineering and math (STEM) subjects, nor English. june 8 2023 Daniel Fogel, the Vice President of the Jerusalem College of Technology. As such, it fails to prepare its graduates to matriculate, succeed in the psychometric exam, study for higher education and enter the workforce with well-paying jobs. When this lack of preparation is combined with the subsidies provided to Haredi families, especially those in which men do not work, nationally, we have created a scenario in which Haredi men are discouraged from working. Haviv Rettig Gur’s recent analysis adds to the chorus on this issue, taking a hardnosed look at Israeli Haredi employment numbers and the impact of decades-long Israeli government support of the Haredi community. It cites the recent warning by the Israeli Finance Ministry, which estimated that with no change in the Haredi employment rate, by 2060 Israel will lose NIS 6.7 trillion in cumulative GDP. For anyone who cares about the future of the State of Israel, this economically apocalyptic forecast must be a clarion call. As a society, we must do something. While the Jerusalem College of Technology (JCT) is not the only school striving to integrate Haredi men into academia and the high-tech work force, we are proud to be the premier school succeeding in that effort. Our track record speaks for itself. JCT is the second-largest institute of higher education in Jerusalem and is proud to have nearly 5,000 students of whom over 2,000 are Haredi men and women. Of our Haredi students, 35% are men. Why are we successful? Simply put, JCT respects Torah. Our academic degree programs are taught alongside Torah study. JCT students excel in computer science and engineering, nursing and bioinformatics, management and accounting, and do so without compromising their religious principles or practice. For Haredi students with no background in core subjects, our one-year preparatory program trains them to the highest level of high school math, physics and English. Thirteen months after they are introduced to arithmetic, they begin degrees in engineering. Many students receive scholarships, subsidies, tutoring and counseling. These forms of assistance significantly reduce the drop-out rate. The “costs” of these forms of aid are paid back to society (in income tax, increased GDP, and a reduction in unemployment related government funding) in fewer than two years. Our alumni go on to top positions as engineers, start-up founders, healthcare professionals, and defense industry and business leaders. Our alumni have a placement rate of over 90% in their field, soon after graduation. The impact is enormous. JCT strengthens the Israeli economy, brings highly trained employees to the high paying workforce, breaks the cycle of impoverished Haredi families and does all this without threatening religious life – which has everything to do with Torah and nothing to do with employment or unemployment. Imagine if societally we incentivized a Haredi man to enter the workforce where he would earn as much or more than his non-Haredi counterpart while remaining true to his values. Instead of gloom-and-doom economic forecasts, we could be speaking of a net gain to Israel’s GDP of NIS 6.7 trillion in the next 30 years. JCT alumni – including Haredi men – enter the workforce earning many times what Haredi families receive in government subsidies. With incomes like these, subsidies are irrelevant. Our graduates support their families and their community and make a positive contribution to the Israeli GDP. Perhaps most importantly, they change the mindset that posits that a Haredi man who enters academia and the high-tech workplace is tantamount (as described by Rettig Gur) to having cast his teffilin into the sea. Israel is strengthened by empowering the Haredi community to join the high earning labor force, while retaining their identity. We are privileged to have partners in this work from across multiple sectors, including Jewish federations, foundations and funds in North America and Europe, the City of Jerusalem, and industry and defense leaders like Intel, Google, Microsoft, Amdocs, Rafael, Elbit, Check Point, Cross River Bank and others. The time for debate about Haredi unemployment and underemployment is over. The time to incentivize Haredi higher education has arrived. We are proud to have a winning model. Winning, for us, means advancing the Jewish people and the Jewish state. Every day we develop new partners strengthening Israel with us – and we need them all in this challenging and sacred work. share in social medias: Previous Update Next Update More Updates Where does Israel go from here?

France, Jerusalem College of Technology, Host Conference on Artificial Intelligence Home Page News and Updates ... France, Jerusalem College of Technology, Host Conference on Artificial Intelligence Leading researchers from Europe arrived in Israel at the end of last month to attend the Artificial Intelligence in Biology and Medicine conference, hosted by the Jerusalem College of Technology (JCT). March 14, 2023 The two-day-long conference was funded in part by the Ministry of Science and Technology and was a result of a collaborative project between JCT and the Institute of Radioprotection and Nuclear Safety (IRSN), Fontenay-aux-Roses in France in the framework of Israel-France “Maïmonide-Israel” research program. Organizers decided to open the event to a broader research community since AI has been steadily finding its use in various studies in radiation biology and medicine. As a result, 25 researchers and R&D specialists from Israel, France, and Germany presented their findings and discussed their innovative work applying AI in biological and medical research. Some of the studies presented included how diverse image processing and machine learning tools can yield an automatic diagnosis of medical and biological images. Additionally, another discussion touched on how artificial intelligence can be used in oral and maxillofacial imaging. Camille Padet, Scientific Cooperation Officer at the French Embassy in Israel said, “Over the past few decades, France has participated in the funding of many research studies in Israel, including at JCT. The team of researchers at JCT is characterized by an innovative and creative worldview that, of course, manifests itself in the quality of the research carried out here. In light of this, I see great importance in the continuation of the establishment of research relations with this institution.” “Artificial intelligence is one of the most fascinating topics in the science and hi-tech industries today,” noted Dr. Yehoshua Socol, organizer of the conference and a lecturer in the Department of Electronics at JCT. “Therefore, establishing international academic connections is critical. JCT has a lot to offer regarding both technology and, particularly, ethics. This conference strengthens our existing international collaborations in this realm and expands our network of connections while also providing us with an infrastructure to advance innovation.” “JCT places great importance on collaborations between academia and research,” said Daniel Fogel, Vice President of JCT. “These networking opportunities are important to students and lecturers alike and encourage taking part in research activities and getting published in scientific journals. I thank Ms. Padet and the French Embassy for strengthening the ties between us.” share in social medias: Previous Update Next Update More Updates Where does Israel go from here?

Additionally, Orkaby teaches courses in pediatric nephrology in hospitals across Israel. “Brurya is a marvelous woman who is dedicated to training the future nurses of Israel, not to mention her tireless work as a nurse in the field of pediatric dialysis at Shaare Zedek,” said Dr. Ahuva Spitz, head of JCT’s Selma Jelinek School Department of Nursing . “We’re grateful and proud that she was recognized for her critical work, particularly on a day when nurses are appreciated around the world.” In another special event organised by MK Tatiana Mizarski, and in the presecnce of Minister of Health Moshe Arbel,  Dr. Spitz, was invited to  addressing the Knesset, \"Health unites us all. And being healthy is something every citizen in the country - regardless of their background - aspires to. As such, every patient longs for a listening ear, professionalism and respect. It is the nurses who provide them with that.\" \" Nurses have a unique personality where they get satisfaction from giving. Giving without hesitation, of course, is a major aspect of religious teachings. As a result, our students and graduates reflect the best of both the religious and medicinal worlds,\" she said. JCT’s Selma Jelinek School of Nursing serves more than 1,000 students annually. It is widely recognized as the country’s premier undergraduate nursing program, having received the Health Ministry’s National Prize for Excellence and ranking first among 24 nursing departments nationwide.

Innovation Odyssey: Discovering the Extraordinary Home Page News and Updates ... Innovation Odyssey: Discovering the Extraordinary Dr. Andrew Viterbi lectures on digital communications at the Jerusalem College of Technology May 1, 2023 San Diegans are well familiar with the name Dr. Andrew Viterbi from the scientific research buildings bearing his family’s name as a result of his philanthropy, as well as from his co-founding of Qualcomm. Just last month, the University of California San Diego broke ground on the Viterbi Family Vision Research Center, which is supported by a $50 million gift he made made in 201i. Yet recently a new audience, situated more than 7,500 miles away, got to hear firsthand from the famed electrical engineer who invented the Viterbi algorithm, which is used in most digital mobile phones and digital satellite receivers, and in diverse fields such as data recording, voice recognition, and DNA sequence analysis. On May 1, Viterbi — the Presidential Chair Professor of Electrical Engineering at the University of Southern California’s Viterbi School of Engineering — gave Jerusalem College of Technology students a lecture on the history of digital communication. He delivered the lecture in honor of his late friend and mentor Solomon Golomb, a mathematician, engineer, and professor of electrical engineering at USC who is partially credited with the creation of the game Tetris. “Both Andrew Viterbi and Solomon Golomb loom large on the world’s stage, but even more so and very intimately at the University of Southern California,” said Alan Wilner, Distinguished Professor of Electrical and Computer Engineering at the Viterbi School of Engineering. “You could say that Andy and Sol have been entangled as quantum particles both personally and professionally for well over half a century.” Viterbi’s lecture in Jerusalem covered what he called the three stages of digital wireless communication — innovation, implementation, and exploitation — and how it has affected society for better or worse. He focused mostly on the pioneers who marked the “Initial Wireless Innovation Era” from 1800 to 1950 and the “Digital Wireless Implementation Era” from 1958 to 2020. From 1997 until 2001, Viterbi served on the President’s Information Technology Advisory Committee. A recipient of many distinguished awards, he won the National Medal of Science under President George W. Bush in 2008 for the Viterbi Algorithm, as well as for his contributions to Code Division Multiple Access, or CDMA, wireless technology that transformed the theory and practice of digital communications. “It’s an unusual pleasure to welcome Dr. Andrew Viterbi to the JCT campus,” said Jerusalem College of Technology President Chaim Sukenik. “The Viterbi family came to the United States fleeing World War II. Dr. Virterbi worked as an engineer and worked for companies developing exciting new technologies, and he was a central part of that.” The relationship between Viterbi and Golomb, Sukenik said, is notable because “they were not only personal friends but worked closely together for many years.” Golomb also received the National Medical of Science, his award from President Barack Obama in 2013. USC’s Wilner noted the significant role that Jewish identity played in the journeys of both Viterbi and Golomb, who died in 2016. “In a postcard of USC announcing Sol will receive the National Medal of Science, I looked closely and saw he wasn’t holding a technical book but a chumash — the five books of Moses,” Wilner said. “Sol felt a special connection to JCT. There is a room in USC that chronicles the Viterbi family and includes Andy’s monumental technical achievements. Importantly, on the display for all to see is the Jewish identity of the Viterbis, including their Sephardic family history and Andy’s Italian Jewish history. “Both Andy and Sol bring to mind the passage in the Talmud that describes the three characteristics that mark the DNA of the Jew — merciful, modestly bashful, and performing acts of kindness. The personal and professional stories of Andy and Sol in all three categories abound.” Today, Solomon Golomb’s daughter Dr. Beatrice Golomb is head of the UC San Diego Golomb Research Group, which studies different conditions related to oxidative stress and cell energy impairments. Solomon Golomb made a donation to JCT to hold an annual lecture in memory of his father, Rabbi Elhanan Zvi Golomb. After her father’s death, Beatrice Golomb re-inaugurated his donation to the Israeli academic institution. In 2021, the lecture series was revived and expanded to also honor Solomon Golomb’s memory. What exactly is Solomon Golomb’s connection to the origins of Tetris? He explained in the IEEE Transactions on Information Theory journal, “I generalized a puzzle problem about putting dominoes on a checkerboard from which a pair of opposite corners had been removed, and created the subject of Polyominoes.” He later wrote the book Polyominoes: Puzzles, Patterns, Problems, and Packings , and “a young Russian, A. Pazhitnov, reading the Russian translation of Polyominoes , was inspired, using my ‘tetromino’ shapes, to invent the computer game Tetris. More people have heard of me from polyominoes than from anything else I have done.” Beatrice Golomb has said regarding her father, “He had this gift of recognizing when mathematical things and physical things bore an interrelation, and this enabled him to make many of the advances that he made.” share in social medias: Previous Update Next Update More Updates Where does Israel go from here?

Schreiber LevTech Entrepreneurship Center Dedication Home Page News and Updates ... Schreiber LevTech Dedication The Schreiber LevTech Entrepreneurship Center was recently dedicated on the Lev Campus in memory of Chaim and in honor of Sara by the Schreiber Charitable Trust of London. 2/4/23 Chaim Shmuel Schreiber was born in 1918 in Turka, a shtetl in Galicia on the river Stry in the Carpathian Mountains. At age 4 his family moved to Lemberg, as it was known under the Austro-Hungarian empire, then in Poland. Nowadays it’s Lviv in Western Ukraine. He had two brothers Yosef and Yehuda. He joined B’nei Akiva and his leader was Yitzchak Raphael – later a minister in Israel and a lifelong friend. Chaim was the only one of his family to survive the Shoa. Chaim loved to sketch in the local museum and taught himself the art of wood inlay. He won a scholarship to study architecture in Vienna and lived there until World War II. He was saved by Leo Grahame in London, who guaranteed for him to settle as a refugee in England. During the War, Chaim used his skills with wood at De Havilland Industries designing the wings of the Mosquito fighter-bomber. During this period he also produced high-quality wood inlay pictures and had an exhibition at Harrods. Chaim married Sara Weinstock in 1942 and they started a business in their small flat in Tottenham making picture frames. They had three children. Developing his knowledge of wood technology, he patented a process for moulding plywood and started producing cabinets for radio and later television. Chaim decided he wanted to produce his own end-product rather than be dependent on the large manufacturers of TVs and he went into the furniture business – first making self-assembly tables sold in Woolworths and later bedroom cabinet furniture and eventually furniture for all the home. Schreiber Furniture become the best-known and most trusted brand in UK furniture by the 1980’s. He merged the company with GEC bringing Hotpoint, Morphy Richards and Schreiber under one management. Schreiber was well ahead of his time in his enlightened policies towards his employees. He believed fervently in the integrity of the working man and built relationships with many thousands of employees on trust and in return earned outstanding loyalty, productivity and commitment. When he was ready to go to an IPO, he cancelled it at the last moment because the government ruled that his scheme to make all his employees shareholders was deemed to be a wage increase which, at that time, was not allowed. His business was the focus of his life and he achieved success and satisfaction. Chaim Schreiber died in 1984. In addition to the naming of the Entrepreneurship Center in his honr, an annual Chaim Schreiber lecture on Halacha and Human Resource Management will be held at JCT. share in social medias: Previous Update Next Update More Updates Where does Israel go from here?

Shira Yered Sebbag's graduation speech Four years after being badly injured in a terrorist attack, Shira Yered-Sebbag addresses fellow graduates at an emotional ceremony. 2/4/23 Four and a half years have passed since we first met. For each one of us, these years were filled with serious and intense studies, and many personal experiences that made us wiser and stronger, and sometimes even challenged us. I would like to share one of my experiences. At the beginning of the first year, I was severely injured in a terrorist attack in Givat Asaf. Throughout the process of healing, we witnessed great miracles. The recovery process required hospitalization for several weeks, followed by several months of rehabilitation. During the medical tests that I underwent because of my injury, a growth was discovered in my brain that required removal. Thank G-d, after recovering from the injury, I successfully underwent surgery to remove the growth. Throughout this whole period, I felt G-d watching over me. The attack occurred on a Thursday, and the next day, Dr. Lori Glick (senior lecturer in the nursing program) stood in my hospital room and said she was here for anything I needed. And that's exactly how it was. Assistance was provided by JCT’s academic staff as well as by administrative staff and management all the way through. For every need that arose - I felt that there was concern, a listening ear, and an attempt to help as much as possible and always with joy and a smiling face. Generally, in higher education, you don't expect the staff to be so caring and sensitive, but here at Machon Tal, any student who needed it, found people who would listen to her and try to help her as much as they could. I want to thank you, on behalf of all of us, for listening, for assistance, for accommodation and creative problem solving, each according to their needs. It is not always possible to find a solution that satisfies everyone, but everyone felt empathy and care. After the terrorist attack, I discovered the dedication of my classmates with whom I had not yet become fully acquainted at this early stage of the academic year. On the first Shabbat after the attack, when I was still fuzzy on the painkillers, girls already came to visit me in the hospital. They expressed their concern, readiness to help, and prayed for my healing. Throughout that first year that I was absent from school, these dear friends recorded and filmed all the lectures (and this was still in the pre-Covid/pre-Zoom era...) and visited to help review the material learnt. One of the things that was important to me after the attack was to keep up with my studies despite the injury. Throughout the year, I felt I could ask for help from any of you, and now, with much thanks to you, I stand here today with you all, at this graduation ceremony. About a year and a half after the attack, I got married to Shlomo, and thank G-d, we have a sweet child, Yedidya, who is a year and a half. I am now working as a community nurse in Mitzpe Ramon. From my own personal experience, I understand the importance of being sensitive towards patients and their needs and maintaining their dignity as much as possible during treatment. The studies at JCT gave me extensive professional knowledge, as well as a holistic view of the patient, so as to provide a response to their various needs. Of course, there is always more to learn, grow and improve, and I try all the time to do better than yesterday. Let us pray that each one of us will be blessed to aid those in need of healing and that we shall not err and cause harm, Amen. share in social medias: Previous Update Next Update More Updates Where does Israel go from here?

Cross River Donates $100,000 for Scholarship Fund at Jerusalem College of Technology Home Page News and Updates ... Cross River Donates $100,000 for Scholarship Fund at Jerusalem College of Technology With the leading fintech bank’s gift, JCT students excelling in the STEM disciplines will receive the Cross River Sophie Hodaya Trakht Scholarship, amounting to $10,000 per student. Feb. 6, 2023 New Jersey-based Cross River Bank has donated $100,000 to establish their new Sophie Hodaya Trakht Scholarship at the Jerusalem College of Technology (JCT). The scholarship will be awarded to 10 academically outstanding students in computer science or engineering students until they graduate. Each student will receive 10,000 NIS (about $2,900) per year, representing a significant contribution to the cost of tuition at JCT. Students excelling in STEM — five from both the Tal Campus for women and the Lev Campus for men — will be selected based on faculty recommendations. Students who have completed at least one year of study are eligible for the scholarship. JCT’s leadership aims to have several recipients from the Haredi community, in line with the college’s mission to empower Israeli Haredim with access to high-level academic opportunities that lead to gainful employment. One of the world’s leading fintech banks, Cross River is a trusted financial services organization that combines the established expertise of a bank with the innovation and product offering of a technology company, based in Fort Lee, N.J. The bank also has an office in Jerusalem which employs over 170 people in software development. Cross River promotes the construction of the financial-technological ecosystem in Jerusalem, the cultivation of jobs, and the expansion of the capabilities and activities of Cross River in the capital of Israel out of a sense of Zionism and belief in the quality of human power in Israel. Former JCT Vice President Stuart Hershkowitz, who sat for many years on the bank’s board of directors, realized that the bank’s community relations efforts to enrich the next generation of STEM students dovetail with the college’s mission in those academic disciplines, making the two institutions natural partners. “What impressed me the most about Cross River is its strong belief in community relations and its consistent work giving back to locals,” Hershkowitz said. “Their interest in helping the best and the brightest here in Israel will help outstanding students in need of a financial boost and enrich the city’s tech ecosystem. Jerusalem College of Technology is grateful for this generous donation, and we’re excited to partner with Cross River on this initiative.” Uriel Goldberg, director of public relations and communications at Cross River, Israel: \"We are happy to award JCT scholarships for outstanding students in the name of Sophie Hodaya Trakht. We see the Jerusalem College of Technology as an important example of the realization of a vision and a way that fits well with Cross River's vision and our desire to strengthen the community in Jerusalem, in particular, and in Israel in general, by increasing the integration of the ultra-orthodox population in the local high-tech industry.\" share in social medias: Previous Update Next Update More Updates Where does Israel go from here?

Participants heard a meaningful D’var Torah from our Campus Coordinator Abby Levi. Abby connected the story of the Israelites’ journey to the Promised Land to the commitment demonstrated by Ori Bnot Sherut and the dedication of our Tal students. She spoke of how the Israelites’ experience of overcoming their struggles and reaching the Promised Land can be a powerful metaphor for the experience of these young women. The experience of making volunteering in Israel and studying at JCT can be trying but is amazingly rewarding.

Nikki Haley Former US Ambassador to the United Nations Nikki Haley told the recent Canadian Friends of Jerusalem College of Technology (CFJCT) 50th anniversary gala dinner 1.12.2022 that she praised Israeli ingenuity and resilience, and also applauded the college for embodying the values that make Israel the global power it is today. “What I love about The Jerusalem College of Technology is that they grow the whole person. They don’t just think about a career, they think about the person, they think about the family and they think about the country. They understand it’s about God first, then country, then family,” she said. “When you look at a college like The Jerusalem College of Technology you see it’s exactly what you need to do to advance women, the country, and family, but to never forget that faith and traditional values matter.” It is precisely the combination of Start-up nation and family values that led to the historical signing of the Abraham Accords, she asserted. “I think back to what we saw happen with the Abraham Accords. When we saw those Arab countries come together, they didn’t come because they were doing Israel a favor. It wasn’t that Israel needed the Arab countries. It’s that the Arab countries needed Israel. And the reason they needed Israel is because Israel continues to focus on her people. Israel continues to focus on being independent. Israel continues to focus on being valuable.” Ambassador Haley went on to note that Antisemitism must be flagged at every instance. “We have to call out antisemitism every time we see it.” the Israel advocate and former South Carolina governor said. “It’s not okay. It will never be okay. We have to speak up every time we see it. We have to humiliate those that do it every time they do it. And we have to remind leaders to speak up.” Her comments to the 500 attendees at the festive dinner hosted by the Canadian Friends of the Jerusalem College of Technology come amidst a national conversation in the United States around a rise in antisemitism.

The guest of honor at the event was CEO of Flytech, Eliran Oren, a start-up recently sold to Aerodrom for NIS 15 million. He thanked JCT and said that the institution had been his second home for eight years, from his first day of school till today, since the company's offices are located on Lev campus. \"The religious public cannot possibly ask for a better greenhouse that combines Torah learning with high-quality and significant academic studies\" noted Oren. \"The reason I founded two companies with my chavrutah stems first and foremost from the desire to start each day studying Torah with the company's employees. JCT graduates are first of all bnei Torah, then academics and industry leaders.

Bioinformatics Bioinformatics is an innovative field, which combines topics in the fields of Life Science and Computer Science, two fields experiencing constant growth and development. 8/21/2022 JCT’s bioinformatics program is pioneering - preparing graduates for issues in contemporary research and applications. Bioinformatics is being used to find solutions for halting the COVID-19 pandemic - starting from the diagnostic stage, to the identification of the virus and its mutations, and the development of vaccines and treatments. Current bioinformatics students are working with Israel’s Ministry of Health, analyzing the genetic data of new variants of the Corona virus under the guidance of a JCT faculty member which has significant international interest from researchers. Our graduates are in demand in academic institutions, in Israel and abroad, for further studies towards postgraduate degrees. Many of the graduates work in the bioinformatics industry and as programmers in the high-tech industry. Our program is also exceptional at encouraging our students to collaborate with research groups during their bachelor studies. Many students participate in studies published in leading journals. A lecturer in our program is a member of the research team at the Weizmann Institute, and a partner in an article published in ‘Science’. A student in our bioinformatics program was involved in a collaborative study on the role of intracellular bacteria in human tumor microbiome. A graduate student finished the BSC program with 7 published articles ! An important advantage of our bioinformatics program is the diverse career opportunities for graduates. In addition to working in industry and studying for postgraduate degrees, the program includes pre-medical courses, which allow graduates to continue to study medicine in other undergraduate programs.

Op ed Cyber Orlee JCT's Cyber Elite's success was recognized by the Israel Innovation Authority march 16 2022 One of the defining challenges in the Israeli economy today centers around the gap between the skills of new graduates and industry's demand for seasoned employees – even for entry-level positions. Many Israeli students, particularly in engineering as well as other science- and technology-related fields, are unable to secure the desired level of employment and compensation upon graduation. Moreover, last year, the State Comptroller issued a report which documented 18,500 vacant positions in the Israeli high-tech industry, resulting from a shortage of skilled university graduates with training in computer science. In this paradoxical situation, the government devotes millions of dollars to recruiting engineers and other high-tech professionals from outside of Israel, even though Israel has a massive pool of students and junior engineers who are available to fill positions. Meanwhile, there are various short-term training programs that offer practical experience in specific computer programming languages – but they often do not provide the building blocks that three or four-year degree programs offer, instilling within students the crucial background knowledge and understanding of computer science and engineering are necessary for genuine advancement in the field. With graduates experiencing a shortage of high-quality positions, and industry experiencing a shortage of qualified applicants, where exactly does the rubber meet the road? To start, it is essential that the government, along with industry, develop long-term partnerships with academia in the quest to strengthen Israel's education-workforce connection. The Jerusalem College of Technology (JCT) has advanced the objective of bridging the aforementioned academia-industry gap through the Cyber Elite program, which provides outstanding Orthodox and Haredi graduates of software engineering and computer science degrees with intensive cyber security training, and simultaneous work in R&D positions in the cyber industry, infusing Israel's high-tech and defense industries with a much-needed new source of highly skilled employees. Most importantly, Cyber Elite functions as a bridge between higher education and industry by empowering students with the practical experience that they need to fill more senior positions upon graduation. JCT created Cyber Elite during the 2017-18 academic year in partnership with the Cyber Education Center, the National Cyber Directorate of the Prime Minister's Office, the Jerusalem Development Authority and leading cyber companies. By directly involving industry in the partnership, we ensured that this training program would respond to specific industry needs. And indeed, the program's first cohort trained and placed its 31 participants – 15 women and 16 men – in cyber security research and development positions in defense and commercial cyber companies. Cyber Elite's success was recognized by the Israel Innovation Authority, which affirmed the program's significance by awarding JCT with a grant for two new Cyber Elite cohorts for the academic years of 2021-22 and 2022-23. The program's more advanced curriculum includes topics like malware analysis, penetration testing, network security, vulnerabilities and exploitations, with training provided by industry experts and former military intelligence personnel. Participants of the current Cyber Elite 2.0 cohort – 19 men and 17 women – spend two days per week on JCT's campuses for men and women. For an additional three days each week, they work in research and development positions at 18 leading cyber security companies and cyber units of multinational companies, including Check Point, Cymotive, Intel, CYE, ARMO, Israel Aerospace Industries/Elta Systems, Rafael Advanced Defense Systems, and Cellebrite. Academic degrees, especially in engineering, remain a crucial element in the road towards employment and combine the theoretical with the practical. But students also need hands-on training in advanced programs, like they receive in Cyber Elite, in order to enter and truly succeed in the workforce. Additionally, designing programs for an institution's most outstanding graduates represents the most effective pathway to producing qualified employees that meet the industry's most pressing needs. By cultivating and maximizing Israel's home-grown talent, the government, academia, and industry can work harmoniously to create systemic change in the Orthodox and ultra-Orthodox sectors and fill pressing gaps in the Israeli workforce. Orlee Guttman is director of strategic partnerships, director of the cyber elite program and co-founder of the LevTech Entrepreneurship Center at the Jerusalem College of Technology. share in social medias: Previous Update Next Update More Updates Where does Israel go from here?

First Ever Health Informatics Program Home Page News and Updates ... health Informatics (1) Israeli government approves Jerusalem College of Technology master’s program in cutting-edge field of health informatics. feb 17 2022 The Jerusalem College of Technology (JCT) on Monday announced that Israel’s Council for Higher Education has approved the Samson Health Informatics Master’s Program, which will enable the College to embark on crucial research and teaching activities in a cutting-edge field that will improve the quality of patient care by utilizing data and technology as the basis for making better clinical decisions. With the support of the Samson Charity Foundation, Israel’s first academic program in health informatics will offer a master’s degree (MHI). This comes five years after JCT initially received guidance and support from the University of Toronto to launch a certificate program in this field. JCT is also collaborating with Jerusalem-based Herzog Hospital and other universities around the world on the program’s academic and research components. Dr. Judith Shamian, former president of the International Council of Nurses and a JCT board member, first proposed the health informatics program as a way to help Israeli ingenuity meet a growing need in the healthcare system. This led to the creation of this innovative, interdisciplinary master’s program. “Although Israel is a world leader in health technology and health informatics, there was not previously an academic program that brought health and technology together to prepare individuals who can work in collaboration with experts in both of those areas to benefit the health care system and all of Israel,” Shamian said. “Thanks to the inspiration provided by the University of Toronto, the dedicated support of the Canadian Friends of JCT, and the generosity of the Samson Charity Foundation, we are able to create Israel’s first high-level health informatics program and cultivate a new generation of professionals who will enhance the Jewish state’s healthcare system.” As health care technology and innovation emphasize improving and advancing quality, safety, and service, it is incumbent upon health workers as well as entrepreneurs to get acquainted with new and innovative theoretical and practical tools — beyond what has been studied at the undergraduate level. Accordingly, Western countries such as the US and Canada have developed health informatics graduate programs which rest on the understanding that professionals operating in this space require interdisciplinary academic training. “In recent years, we have witnessed the entry of technology giants such as Google, Apple, Facebook, IBM, and others into the field of health. There is no doubt that the health industry has a pressing need for the graduates of our program, whose skill set is well-adapted to the current and future world of health technology,” said Dr. Sigal Shafran Tikva, who developed the curriculum and built the program and now is Head of the Samson Health Informatics Master’s Program. JCT’s curriculum is designed for health care workers (including physicians, dentists, nurses, pharmacists, physical therapists, occupational therapists, and emergency medical professionals), as well as for experts in economics, law, management, and engineering. It will reach out to a diverse professional clientele who are looking to expand their academic background and skills in the world of healthcare technology. The program will instill knowledge, tools, skills, and the language that enables hybrid communication between disciplines. It will allow graduates to define and characterize health-related aspects of different technologies so as to provide optimized treatment, while maximizing the benefits of new technologies in the workplace. \"The Samson Charity Foundation is proud to support such a critical initiative. Combining the innovation found in the Start-up Nation, the excellent students at Jerusalem College of Technology, and the robust curriculum created by JCT and the University of Toronto should be a winning formula that will enhance the medical industry in Israel and beyond.” said Mr. Pieter Biermann, President of the foundation. share in social medias: Previous Update Next Update More Updates Where does Israel go from here?

JCT Mentorship Program Helps Students Jumpstart Careers Home Page News and Updates ... Mentoring Program ESP The new mentorship program helps place international students in fields that interest them so they can gain valuable experience while still in school 8 Feb 2022 “From my first meeting with Michael, I can see that he is very knowledgeable and was particularly helpful in clarifying exactly what path I would like to pursue in the computer science field,” says Jerusalem College of Technology (JCT) computer science student Benjamin Klein of his mentor, Michael Rochlin, a product and software developer at Chapter, a technology-driven Medicare advisor improving how seniors choose health coverage. Klein is among the first 45 students from JCT’s International Program in English to benefit from a recently launched mentorship program, in which students can ask seasoned professionals in their fields everything from how to present themselves during a job interview to how they handle day-to-day workplace challenges. The mentorship .initiative instills within students the valuable life skills that cannot be taught in a classroom. Students meet with mentors over Zoom, once every six to eight weeks. “The mentorship program is very exciting to me because I am able to get advice and guidance from someone who has gone through the same process as me and is already working in the field,” Klein says. JCT’s International Program offers young men and women from around the world the viable opportunity to live and study Torah in Israel while pursuing a prestigious academic degree in Computer Sciences or Business Administration. Following three critically formative and intensive years of study, students emerge prepared not only to embark on successful career paths but also thriving life paths that maintain an abiding fidelity to Torah and Israel. Operating in tandem with the College’s internship program, the new mentorship program helps place students in fields that interest them so they can gain valuable experience while still studying towards their degree. “To be successful in Israel, you have to have strong skills, a robust network of connections, and mentors who are willing to show you the ropes,” said International Program Coordinator Shlomo Anapolle. “Our mentorship program empowers students with all of those benefits. All students, no matter their background, can face the challenge of transitioning from college to the professional world. This program aims to make that adjustment smoother.” In addition to Chapter, participating mentors have hailed from the IDF; Preqin, a privately held London-based investment data company; Clairfield, an international corporate finance firm; NanoScout, a revolutionary software product that allows multiple industries to find, solve, and diagnose problems; and Chapter, a technology-driven Medicare advisor improving how seniors choose health coverage. By getting to know their mentees, the mentors give their companies access to recruiting potential interns and entry-level employees from the broad and talented pool of JCT graduates. Klein, meanwhile, calls the program “a great opportunity for me to expand my network of connections to Michael and beyond.” “I hope to continue hearing more advice from him about how to prepare for and advance my career,” he says, “and to see which other people he can connect me with to help and guide me as well.” A virtual open house for the International Program will be taking place on February 27, 2022, at 8:00pm IST / 1:00pm EST for women and 9:00pm IST / 2:00pm IST for men.

Master’s Program in Cutting-Edge Field of Health Informatics Home Page News and Updates ... health informatics Samson Health Informatics Master’s Program expands the certificate offering of Israel’s first academic program in health informatics, launched in partnership with University of Toronto feb 1 2022 The Jerusalem College of Technology (JCT) today announced that Israel’s Council for Higher Education has approved the Samson Health Informatics Master’s Program, which will enable the College to embark on crucial research and teaching activities in a cutting-edge field that aims to improve the quality of patient care by utilizing data as the basis for making better clinical decisions. With the support of the Samson Charity Foundation, Israel’s first academic program in health informatics will expand from a certificate offering to a master’s degree, five years after JCT initially partnered with the University of Toronto to launch the program. JCT has also collaborated with Jerusalem-based Herzog Hospital and German universities on the program’s academic and research components. Judith Shamian, former president of the International Council of Nurses and a JCT board member, first proposed the health informatics program as a way to help Israeli ingenuity meet a growing need in the healthcare system, through the vehicle of higher education. “Although Israel is a world leader in innovations in health technology, health data, and health informatics, there was not previously an academic program that brought health and technology together to prepare individuals who can work in collaboration with experts in both of those areas to synergize and benefit the population, the country, and the health system,” Shamian said. “Thanks to the inspired collaboration of University of Toronto, the dedicated support of Canadian Friends of JCT, and the generosity of the Samson Charity Foundation, we are now able to take Israel’s first health informatics program to the next level in its quest to cultivate a new generation of professionals who will enhance the Jewish state’s healthcare system.” As the present and future eras of health technology and innovation emphasize improving and advancing quality, safety, and service, it is incumbent upon health workers as well as entrepreneurs to get acquainted with new theoretical and practical bodies of knowledge and to learn innovative tools — most of which they did not study at the undergraduate level. Accordingly, Western countries such as the U.S. and Canada have developed health informatics graduate programs which rest on the understanding that multi-professional work requires interdisciplinary academic training. In bringing health informatics training to Israel for the first time, JCT’s curriculum is designed for physicians, dentists, nurses, pharmacists, physical therapists, occupational therapists, emergency medical professionals, economics and management experts, engineers, behavioral science professionals, computer scientists, lawyers, and workers in other fields who are looking to expand their academic background and skills in today’s and tomorrow’s informatics and technological world. The program instills knowledge, tools, skills, and the language that enables hybrid communication between disciplines, allowing graduates to define and characterize health-related requirements from technology in order for them to provide optimal treatment, while maximizing technology in their workplace. “In recent years, we have witnessed the entry of technology giants such as Google, Apple, Facebook, IBM, and more into the field of health. There is no doubt that the health industry has a pressing need for the graduates of our program, whose skill set is well-adapted to the current and future health technological world,” said Sigal Shafran, Head of the Samson Health Informatics Master’s Program. share in social medias: Previous Update Next Update More Updates Where does Israel go from here?

Perpetuating the memory of Noam Apter z\"l Home Page News and Updates ... 19 Yarzheit of Noam Apter z'l Memorial ceremony in memory of the 19th anniversary of the murder of Noam Apter z\"l, son of Yossi (graduate and former CEO of JCT)and Pirchiya Apter dec 30 2021 Every year, Yossi and Pirchiya Apter, Noam’s parents, donate a scholarship to a JCT Beit Midrash students to commemorate their son who was murdered in in Otniel settlement, while blocking the way of a terrorist who infiltrated his Hesder Yeshiva and was attempting to enter the fully occupied dining room of the yeshiva. Noam’s parents decided to perpetuate Noam's memory  through a scholarship, and it became common practice that on his yahrzeit, a shiur is given in his memory by the scholarship recipient student. Amit Guetta, a third-year student studying towards a degree in the Electro-Optics Engineering, was chosen as the scholarship recipient this year. Amit shared with all the attendees that he was highly impressed with what he learned about Noam’s character, who advocated the connection between worlds. Before starting his shiur, he disclosed his personal life story . \"For the most part of my life, I was not a religious person. I went to a secular school and to Tzofim boy scouts until I reached the army. In the military service, I served in the ‘Egoz’ unit, and met, for the first time in my life, religious soldiers from Atzmona and Eli. Religion wasn't new to me because my grandfather used to go to synagogue, but actually being acquainted with people my age whose lifestyle was religious, was new to me. Their behavioral and moral codes impressed me. The process of ‘tshuva’ was ignited by the moral issue; the connection between myself and Hashem was a process that grew gradually, and also influenced by the meeting of my future wife.  I immediately fell in love with her and found myself becoming much closer to religion. She felt uncomfortable about me making these changes for her and wasn’t initially sure how much it was coming from a genuine love of Judaism and religion. It was clear to me that I was on the right track, and I registered to study at Machon Meir where my connection to Judaism was strengthened alongside the understanding how I wish my life to look like.\" As I grew in my connection to Judaism, I realized that I cannot be a a Kollel avrach, but that I have to learn a profession in order to support myself and my family.  I searched for a framework that would allow me to meet my religious and academic needs.  I had never heard of JCT – Lev Academic Center until one of my friends told me about it. I came here to find out what programs they offered, rather than choosing my degree program and then finding the institution.  Generally, you choose an academic institution according to the profession you’re interested in, but the integration between kodesh studies in the Beit Midrash and academic studies to earn a profession was too great a gift to give up.  I love the path my life is taking and I am so grateful to my friend who introduced me to Machon Lev. share in social medias: Previous Update Next Update More Updates Where does Israel go from here?

Jerusalem College of Technology to launch Israel's first nursing master's degree in English Home Page News and Updates ... MSN Nursing The new English-language program is set to launch during the 2022-23 academic year. \"New immigrants and visitors to Israel are consistently looking for high-quality programs in English; they do not want their education to involve compromises,\" JCT official says. 21/12/2021 The Jerusalem College of Technology announced Sunday that the Israeli Council for Higher Education has approved plans to open Israel's first English-language Master of Science in Nursing (MSN) degree, which will expand upon the success of JCT's top-ranked Bachelor of Science in Nursing (BSN) program. The government supports the initiative with the goal of offering more English-language programs that will lead to increased enrollment from international students in Israeli academic institutions. JCT's Selma Jelinek School of Nursing currently serves more than 1,200 students annually. It is widely recognized as one of the country's premier undergraduate nursing programs, having received the Health Ministry's National Prize for Excellence and ranking first among 24 nursing departments nationwide. The new English-language MSN program, which will initially be open to women, is set to launch during the 2022-23 academic year. The master's degree will feature the same coursework as the College's Hebrew-language nursing program \"New immigrants and visitors to Israel are consistently looking for high-quality programs in English; they do not want their education to involve compromises,\" said Professor Freda Ganz, dean of JCT's Faculty of Life and Health Sciences. \"Given the significant demand in Israel for such programs, particularly in nursing, JCT is well-positioned to fill this need.\" JCT's Hebrew-language MSN in Nursing Internal Medicine track was launched in October and is designed for nurses with a bachelor's degree who work in hospital departments of internal medicine, neurology, intensive care, infectious diseases and others. The initiative marked JCT's response to the unprecedented importance that the field of internal medicine has taken on during the coronavirus pandemic, with surging demand for specialist care to treat patients with complex illness causing the overcrowding of internal medicine wards. Both the existing Hebrew-language nursing track and the forthcoming English-language program equip students to tackle the rising challenge of comorbidity (the simultaneous presence of two or more medical conditions) for patients who are in need of complex medical care. The master's program provides graduates with the knowledge and tools to make informed decisions and treat different demographic groups, both in hospitals and community clinics, amid today's evolving environment in which nurses require a more diverse skill set. The nursing program's curriculum expands proficiencies in areas such as applying research and data to clinical care and decision-making; leadership; comprehensive and dynamic treatment planning for health needs; patient-centered care; pain relief and the preservation of patients' quality of life, epidemiology and public health; and the intersection of philosophy, ethics, law and Halachah (Jewish law) in the field of nursing. share in social medias: Previous Update Next Update More Updates Where does Israel go from here?

From India to the Holy Land: The journey of an immigrant from the Bnei Menashe Community Home Page News and Updates ... Rivka Hilsia Rivka Hilsia may have grown up in India, but as a member of the Bnei Menashe Community, her heart has always been in Israel dec 20 2021 Rivka Hilsia may have grown up in Manipur, India, but as a member of the Bnei Menashe, her heart has always been with Israel. Rivka is just one of the 4,500 Bnei Menashe members who were granted permission to make aliyah (immigrate to Israel), due to their belief that they are direct descendants of Menashe (Manasseh), one of the ten tribes of Israel which split from the southern kingdom of Judea. Her ancestors wandered through Central Asia and the Far East and finally settled across two Indian villages, Manipur and Mizoram. Despite being isolated from the rest of the Jewish world, the Bnei Menashe have continued to devoutly follow their faith, but it was only until the late 1990s that they were allowed to fulfill their aliyah dreams. Yet for Hilsia and many others like her, the aliyah process was not always a dream. Today, she is a student at the Jerusalem College of Technology (JCT), but her road to success was a long one. Now, Hilsia explains the challenges inherent in her aliyah, what drew her to the College, her plans for the future, and what makes living in Israel so special. What was your Aliyah experience like? “I made Aliyah seven years ago with my mother and sister,” Hilsia recalled. “We arrived here as a community from the Bnei Menashe. The aliyah experience from India to Israel and being absorbed into the country was both an exhilarating and challenging experience. It’s like your entire life changes in one day.” “We expected challenges, of course. My parents didn’t speak any English and were too old to learn Hebrew, but we made aliyah knowing it was going to be difficult because this is our land. Usually, parents are the ones who look after the children, but in this new country where they can’t communicate and fear people may think they’re stupid, they felt helpless and couldn’t look after us in the ways they hoped to. “So, we had to look after them. We took them to offices, clinics and general errands. My mother worked long 12-hour days in a factory. It was grueling, but it was enough to provide for us. However, when she got back from work, there was little energy left for us, but there was no choice. “My sister and I had our own challenges, too. Adapting to the country socially and mentally was difficult and, at times, it felt like we needed to channel a confidence we didn’t really have to get by. Caring for our parents was also time-consuming, so we couldn’t have the childhood that most of our peers had. Many of us didn’t even have the option of higher education, because we were expected to earn a salary immediately after school. I’m so privileged that my life diverged from this path. “Yet, despite the challenges, we strove to be happy because these obstacles — however great — did make life interesting and made us stronger. I’m proud of the woman I’ve become and my family for sticking together during that difficult period. Most of all, I’m grateful to Hashem, who gave me the strength to be in Israel and grapple with whatever life throws at me.” Why did you want to come to Israel? “We are Jews, and this is our land. I didn’t want to live the rest of my life on land that belongs to someone else. This is, simply, where I need to be,” she emphasized. What brought you to JCT? “This is a place where you are able to study both technology and holy Scripture. I think it’s important to have faith, so we feel led to a righteous way of life. It’s important for me to feel close to God, and this framework makes it possible for me to do that and pursue a robust academic degree at the same time.” What are you studying? “I’m currently enrolled in a master's program in Bioinformatics,” Hilsia responded. “I saw myself interested in many different scientific subjects — physics, chemistry, etc. I discovered this discipline that combines all of these subject matters and I was drawn to the variety and interdisciplinary nature of this area of study.” “I’m really enjoying my time at the College so far. To be religious and to be an educated woman is how I want to build my life here. This was my vision prior to coming to Israel, so why not do it in the best way possible? “So, in many ways, JCT is ideal for people like me who want a balanced life with regard to the holy and secular. I’m so happy I found Machon Lev and that it exists.” What are the plans for the future? “I’m not entirely sure yet,” she admitted. “I love what I’m studying, and I know I want to delve more in technological development as a potential career path. This is a lucrative discipline with many different avenues for advancement.” “On a personal level, of course, I’m looking forward to getting married and having a family.” share in social medias: Previous Update Next Update More Updates Where does Israel go from here?

Tzipporah Felsenthal Being a teenager is a formative time in a young person’s life — the early stage of determining what kind of adult you hope to grow into, what your values are, and what path you want to pursue in life 12 december 2021 Being a teenager is a formative time in a young person’s life — the early stage of determining what kind of adult you hope to grow into, what your values are, and what path you want to pursue in life. At 14, I can’t say I knew very much about who I wanted to be and what my life goals were. However, when my parents made it clear that they were ready to make Aliyah from Passaic, NJ, I knew it was a challenge I was going to embrace head-on. As an Orthodox Jew, I knew in my heart that Israel was where G=d wanted me to be, and He would never put me in a situation that I can’t handle. Indeed, arriving in Israel in 2015 with little Hebrew-language skills and no friends isn’t a recipe for success — but somehow, after much trial and error, I found ways to make it work. Upon arriving at school, I’d attempt to understand my classes — all taught in Hebrew — and feverishly take copious notes, only to review them later and realize they were incoherent and throw them away. In the first year, I socialized exclusively with Americans all day and realized that was holding me back from truly picking up on the language. Slowly, I began only speaking Hebrew to every single person I encountered in school – American and Israeli alike. It was a difficult process, but eventually, I graduated high school with a certificate of matriculation in all of my Hebrew classes. That road wasn’t easy to navigate, but I’m so glad I did. Looking back on my struggles during that time, as a special project during my gap year, I wanted to help other young olim (immigrants) who found themselves in similar situations. To that end, I launched the Teen Survival Guide to Aliyah as a resource for young new immigrants. It’s a resource in which olim can obtain anecdotal tips from other immigrants who successfully integrated into Israel, correspond with an Israeli pen-pal, find other olim for bible study and much more. When faced with so many challenges during what can already be a difficult time in a young person’s life, it’s easy to be weighed down by negativity. I hope my site shows olim that there’s a better way forward and that they can take charge of their Aliyah experience no matter how difficult it may be. Today, I’m studying computer science at the Jerusalem College of Technology (JCT) in their International Program in English. I’m grateful for the hard work I put in that enabled me to be here to not only study both Torah and this high-upside career path that interests me, but to do so in the home of the Jewish people. At JCT, Torah and technology feed into each other, so much so that even during coding classes, my instructor uses examples from the Torah to show why certain formulas work. It’s a real privilege to study in an institution that understands that I don’t have to choose between the religious and secular worlds, and that they can coexist in harmony. But most of all, I’m grateful to be in Israel. As I travel on buses and take in the diverse landscapes of the country from the holy sites of Jerusalem to the rolling hills of Judea and Samaria, I can’t imagine myself settling anywhere else.

Tracking device wins 1st place at JCT's hackathon Home Page News and Updates ... hackathon 2021 mens The winning team, Wi-Find, developed an easy-to-use solution using inexpensive components that can pick up data from the signals around it. 12 december 2021 At the 6th annual Jerusalem College of Technology (JCT) Great Minds Hackathon, a team of three JCT students took home first place for their development of advanced software to better locate equipment. The winning team, Wi-Find, developed an easy-to-use solution using inexpensive components that can pick up data from the signals around it. They developed a way to process the information and map out the exact location of the object. Real-world uses for the technology include places such as hospitals and construction sites  where there is a closed structure and therefore standard GPS cannot be used as it is not accurate enough within buildings. Two of Wi-Find's members are international students, Yosef Mizrahi is from Brazil and Ariel Szmerla is from France. The third team member is Amitai Salomon from Israel. Over 100 Orthodox and Ultra-Orthodox male JCT and international students took part in the hackathon , which is run by the LevTech Entrepreneurship Center of JCT.  The center also includes a pre-accelerator program to help students turn their ideas into products and start-ups. The winners were chosen by a panel of nine judges from established Israeli and international companies. Orlee Guttman, one of the event's organizers and co-founder of LevTech said all of the student participants demonstrated creativity and effort. \"They learned new technologies in a matter of hours and then created new products using them. As we’ve seen in past years, their innovation and drive continues after the hackathon as well, as they work to bring these products to market, improve consumer experience and business efficiency, and often help save lives at the same time,\" Guttman said. share in social medias: Previous Update Next Update More Updates Where does Israel go from here?

Jerusalem College of Technology launches trailblazing cyber security program Home Page News and Updates ... Jerusalem College of Technology launches trailblazing cyber security program With support from Israel Innovation Authority, Cyber Elite 2.0 set to build on success of pilot program, bolstering Israel’s cyber industry. Cyber Elite 2.0 Michael Erenburg The Jerusalem College of Technology (JCT) – Lev Academic Center has launched Cyber Elite 2.0, which provides outstanding Orthodox and haredi graduates of software engineering and computer science degrees with intensive cyber security training while infusing Israel’s hi-tech and defense industries with a much-needed new source of highly skilled employees. The pilot for Cyber Elite was created in the 2017-18 academic year in partnership with the Cyber Education Center, the National Cyber Directorate of the Prime Minister’s Office, and leading cyber companies to ensure that the training program responds to specific industry needs. The program trained and placed its 31 participants — 15 women and 16 men – in cyber security research and development positions in defense and commercial cyber companies. During that pilot year, Cyber Elite students participated in Israel’s national Cyber Week competition. Among the 400 initial competitors, only 90 advanced to the final round. Twenty percent of them were from Cyber Elite, including the only women who made it to the final round. All the alums remain working in high-level hi-tech research and development positions today. Based on the training and hands-on experience of the pilot, the skills of these Orthodox and haredi men and women surpassed what was expected. This success was also recognized by the Israel Innovation Authority, which affirmed the program’s significance by awarding JCT with a grant for two new Cyber Elite cohorts for the academic years of 2021-22 and 2022-23. Now, the program has a more advanced curriculum which includes topics such as malware analysis, penetration testing, network security, vulnerabilities and exploitations, and more, with training provided by industry experts and former military intelligence personnel. The Cyber Elite 2.0 cohort will spend two days per week on JCT’s campuses for men (Machon Lev) and women (Machon Tal). For an additional three days each week, participants will work in research and development positions at 18 leading cyber security companies and cyber units of multinational companies, including Check Point, Cymotive, Intel, CYE, ARMO, Israel Aerospace Industries/Elta Systems, Rafael Advanced Defense Systems, Cellebrite and more. The new cohort consists of 36 students — 19 men and 17 women — who are all from Orthodox and haredi backgrounds. They gained admission into the 10-month program among a group of hundreds of other potential applicants, following a rigorous screening process that included interviews with former military intelligence and team leaders in the cyber industry. The participants are now engaging with a curriculum developed in consultation with the defense and commercial cyber industries, which in turn will help its graduates become a new source of personnel at the highest level of the cyber security research and development sector. “At its core, Israeli ingenuity is about best utilizing and amplifying the ideas and skills of the people of Israel,” said Orlee Guttman, Director of the Cyber Elite program . “We are thrilled that Cyber Elite will be able to provide the country with new, incredible talent that previously would never have had an entry into the cyber world. These men and women will bring major added value to the country's commercial and defense cyber industries.” The primary path to senior positions in Israel’s cyber industry is participation in cyber units within the military. That makes the field virtually inaccessible to computer science and software engineering graduates from the haredi and National Religious communities, men and women, who are traditionally not represented in those army intelligence units. This ultimately means that Israel’s commercial and defense cyber sectors are missing out on outstanding engineers from across the religious community — but Cyber Elite is filling that void. “Virtually all of my co-workers came through the IDF, people with many years of experience,” said Yechiel Levin. Levin grew up in the haredi school system, came to JCT with minimal knowledge in core subjects and worked hard to graduate with a computer science degree. He is a graduate of the Cyber Elite pilot and has been working as an engineer in the cyber industry ever since. He credits JCT and Cyber Elite for his success. “I wouldn’t have been able to reach my current cyber security position through a regular job, no matter how talented and professional I am. The skills that we attained throughout the Cyber Elite program and the connections that we made with the industry enabled me to get to where I am today,” he explained.

Professor studies clues to climate change from outer space Home Page News and Updates ... Professor studies clues to climate change from outer space To celebrate World Space Week, we spoke to space scientist Prof. Paul Kamoun about global warming, a space factory for drugs, and Israel’s Moon mission. “ We are not able to say that the contribution of man to global warming is exactly this or that. If we had that data in our hands, all the countries of the world would more likely reach a consensus about what to do.” It’s World Space Week. And although Prof. Paul Kamoun is on Planet Earth, heading the space technology and remote sensing laboratory at Jerusalem College of Technology , his gaze has drifted upward for the past 40 years. Climate change, drug development and Israel’s Moon mission are just three areas that keep his eyes trained on outer space. With a PhD in earth and planetary sciences from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, the French-born Kamoun worked on more than 150 projects with US space agency NASA, European space agency ESA and French space agency CNES. He handles international business development for Swiss company SpacePharma , whose miniature made-in-Israel laboratories take advantage of gravity-free outer space for the development of new drugs. He was an independent telecommunications consultant for the privately funded SpaceIL Beresheet spacecraft to the Moon in April 2019, which crash landed, and hopes to send an experiment aboard Beresheet 2 in 2024. Perhaps most urgently, Kamoun is studying the causes and consequences of climate change using satellite imagery. Who and what is responsible? We know that mass industry and fossil fuels play a role in consequences such as global warming and polar ice cap melting, Kamoun says. However, we don’t know the extent of manmade causes or how they compare to natural causes such as the sun’s cycle, the Earth’s behavior and the interaction between the atmosphere and the ocean. “There is no doubt that there is global warming. But we don’t have enough data to quantify the causes with scientific accuracy. We need to accumulate about 30 years of satellite data to do that, and we have about 15 years of data so far,” Kamoun says. “We are not able to say that the contribution of man to global warming is exactly this or that. If we had that data in our hands, all the countries of the world would more likely reach a consensus about what to do,” says Kamoun. He encourages his students to design next-gen satellites to discover more about the Earth and space, and how to use satellite data to improve our world. Big technology, small budget Indeed, advanced space technologies are a specialty in Israel despite its very modestly funded space program. “NASA has huge budget of more than $23 billion for 2021, while Europe altogether has about a $5 billion yearly space budget, and Israel… maybe $20 million,” Kamoun tells ISRAEL21c. “What can you do with that kind of budget? You can make great technology for space programs, both inside and outside Israel.” For example, he says, Ramon Space is developing high-power processors for supercomputing in space. Elbit Systems is developing highly advanced electro-optics solutions for space among other applications. “It’s hard to compare the number of satellites or space missions with players like NASA, but you can compare the technology — and ours is top level,” Kamoun says. Israeli scientists have had fruitful collaborations with NASA, he adds, “although not as much as could be done and not very visible.” NASA provided, for instance, important means of communication for Beresheet 1. And many Israeli scientists are collaborating with US counterparts to prepare NASA’s future Moon and Mars missions, he adds. Some of Kamoun’s graduate students are examining digital satellite images from VENuS, the first cooperative Earth observation program of the Israel Space Agency and France’s CNES. The uses of such imagery are almost endless, says Kamoun. For now they are focused on identifying the evolution of vegetation and water in northern Israel. Plans for Israel’s next Moon mission Kamoun hopes to have his students design physics and electro-optics experiments for Beresheet 2, which will include two ultralight lunar landers and an orbiter that will circle the Moon for several years and host experiments from students. One possibility is an onboard physics experiment relating to Einstein’s theory of relativity. “Another idea is to design and attach a small camera or sensor on the landers, to help find the best place to land during descent and then to take images during and after landing,” says Kamoun. He will have to scramble to make SpaceIL’s November deadline for proposals for experiments to fly on Beresheet 2. “It’s complicated: You need to find a good scientific case, design the right instrumentation to solve the scientific question, and find the funding for it. Usually governments take care of the money. But in privately funded missions like Beresheet, financing is as tricky as the science project itself,” he says. First drug factory in orbit Kamoun’s experiences in space programs of the United States, Europe and parts of Asia made him the natural choice to lead international business development for SpacePharma. Based in Switzerland with R&D and business development in Israel, SpacePharma capitalizes on the fact that the physical, chemical and biological conditions in space offer unique conditions for drug development. SpacePharma’s portable lab allows big pharma and independent scientists alike to develop experiments and products in space. “It’s already been in space five times, and we have two more missions coming up in the next five months, including one with Israeli astronaut Eytan Stibbe,” says Kamoun. Stibbe is expected to take 44 experiments on next year’s mission to the International Space station, from fields including agriculture, neurology and optics. “SpacePharma is also developing the first drug factory in orbit, which should be launched in the end of 2023,” adds Kamoun. “It will be the first building block of our larger-scale space factory for drugs. It will be a fantastic paradigm change for developing new drugs faster and even cheaper than on Earth.” Believe it or not, he says, the cost of R&D in outer space is becoming compatible with the skyrocketing cost of R&D on Earth. Will Kamoun ever have a chance to enter outer space for himself? “It is naturally a dream to go to space to see our beautiful Earth from far and to see the marvelous planets of the solar system from close,” he says. “But except for a few lucky or wealthy guys, this will be most probably for the generation of our students and children – if, of course, the technology and most importantly the reliability of human space flight progress enough.” https://www.israel21c.org/professor-studies-clues-to-climate-change-from-outer-space/ share in social medias: Previous Update Next Update More Updates Where does Israel go from here?

Education is crucial for integration of haredim into society - opinion Home Page News and Updates ... Education is crucial for integration of haredim into society - opinion Some argue for a “tough love” approach to the haredi community, but there’s a better way forward Politicians, lay leaders and experts have various theories as to how to integrate haredim (ultra-Orthodox) into broader Israeli society. It’s a subject of conversation that often makes headlines, especially during waves of demonstrations against the country’s military conscription. Some argue for a “tough love” approach to the haredi community, including revoking government benefits such as childcare subsidies and privileges like exemption from military service. But there’s a better way forward: using the vehicle of higher education to integrate haredim into society, offering them opportunities to enter the job market while also enabling them to continue their devotion to Torah. This is a realistic solution. At the Jerusalem College of Technology (JCT), we don’t demand that haredim compromise their identity in order to achieve socioeconomic advancement. By offering a dual curriculum featuring comprehensive higher education in STEM (science, technology, engineering and mathematics) subjects alongside Torah studies, JCT manages to accomplish two important objectives: bring haredim into the fold so they no longer need to rely on government subsidies in order to provide for their families, and narrow the educational gap between haredim and the rest of Israeli society. Haredim are very much like other members of Israeli society. They love their families. They have dreams and aspirations. They want shalom bayit (domestic harmony) not only in their homes, but in their country. Removing state benefits assumes that haredim will only integrate into society in the face of punitive measures and that they will not respond to positive incentives. Another common misconception is that haredi students largely do not study a core curriculum of secular subjects. JCT students not only study math and science, but they embrace it and all the opportunities that come along with such studies. Yes, they typically start without the prerequisite knowledge needed for higher education, but our college preparatory (mechina) course enables them to catch up. Does the environment at JCT reflect the majority of Israel’s haredi population? No. But our haredi enrollment numbers – which rose from 200 in 2011 to 2,000 in 2020 – show a growing demand for STEM in that sector. Our haredi students attain an 89% employment rate once they graduate, and they also shatter gender stereotypes. Some 53% of our computer science students are women, which is 18% more than any other Israeli academic institution. The different lifestyles of the haredi and secular worlds add to the challenge of understanding one another. That is another reason why coming to the table, exploring options and providing helpful solutions is a more effective alternative than threats. Haredim need opportunities and incentives to integrate. Educators and their institutions have the responsibility to provide every citizen in Israel with the chance and the tools to pursue higher education – whether they choose to seize that opportunity is up to them. When given the chance, many haredim have demonstrated curiosity, engagement and even the desire to embrace higher education, and to enter the job market, all while maintaining their devotion to Torah. According to the Central Bureau of Statistics, haredim are on track to comprise one-third of the Israeli population by 2065. Let’s embrace that reality rather than continuing to see demographic doom and gloom. Let’s pave a path for haredim that includes a rich, bountiful life alongside a commitment to Torah. Let’s approach haredi students as adults who are eager to move forward and to be the best they can be. Let’s favor the carrot over the stick.

Jerusalem college dedicates new dorm for religious students Home Page News and Updates ... Jerusalem college dedicates new dorm for religious students Jerusalem College of Technology dedicates new dormitory supported by gift from Jewish Legacy Charitable Foundation. The Jerusalem College of Technology (JCT) last week dedicated a new dormitory supported by a donation from the Toronto-based Jewish Legacy Charitable Foundation (JLCF), that will offer students an affordable high-quality housing option on campus, removing the obstacle of Jerusalem’s high cost of living. The Israeli government matched the foundation’s gift towards the construction of the new Joseph and Faye Tanenbaum Residence Hall, a project totaling more than 35 million NIS ($11 million). \"As the former Minister of Higher Education and current Minister of Jerusalem Affairs, I've been privileged to work closely with the Jerusalem College of Technology. The college is one of the best academic institutions in Israel,” said MK Ze'ev Elkin (New Hope), Minister of Jerusalem Affairs and Minister of Housing and Construction. “Its unique contribution is reflected in its goal to provide higher education alongside comprehensive Torah studies, enabling integration of the haredim in the workforce and landing them some of the most desirable jobs on the market.\" Tuesday’s dedication ceremony was attended by Jerusalem Mayor Moshe Lion, MK Elkin, and other government dignitaries. \"The Jerusalem College of Technology is a source of pride for the city. The college is a symbol of innovation, excellence, and creativity. It also contributes to the advancement of the city in a myriad of ways and integrates and empowers underserved communities in both the academic and professional worlds,” said Mayor Lion. “The Jerusalem Municipality will continue to dedicate itself to supporting the development of this fine institution.\" JLCF and its founder, the late Joseph Tanenbaum, have a long history of supporting JCT — deriving from Tanenbaum’s lifelong passion for supporting Jewish education. The foundation has donated tens of millions of dollars to more than 200 institutions (primarily schools and synagogues) in Canada, the US, Israel, and worldwide. Tanenbaum was also one of the most successful real estate developers in Toronto during the 1960s and ’70s in Toronto, which served as inspiration for JLCF’s donation for the JCT dormitory. “We all know the expensive nature of real estate in Jerusalem, making it very difficult for students from outlying areas to attend the College. This facility allows young people, men and women, and families to be located on the campus in a dignified way and be able to live on campus in a beautiful and admirable setting,” said Jack Feintuch, a board member of JLCF. JCT has a long track record of opening doors to gainful employment for Israel’s haredi population. The College’s haredi graduates have attained an 89-percent employment rate, far exceeding the roughly 50-percent employment rate for haredi men throughout Israel. Further, 53 percent of all JCT’s computer science students are women, which is 18 percent higher than any other Israeli academic institution. “It is no secret that if you walk through the streets of Jerusalem and throughout Israel, the name Joseph Tanenbaum is prominently displayed in buildings and facilities all across the land,” Feintuch said. “Joe, together with Faye, spent a lifetime of promoting Torah learning, Torah values, and a Torah lifestyle that they believed represent the future of our people and of the State of Israel.” “Today, we are very proud to affiliate with an institution such as JCT that stresses both Torah learning and academics, while empowering observant young men and women to learn technology disciplines in a Torah atmosphere. We believe that the College’s mission is critical for the survival of the Jewish people.” The new dormitory will fill a unique need of offering a comfortable housing option for the significant number of JCT students who are part of religiously observant young families. “The Joseph and Faye Tanenbaum Residence Hall is both a fitting tribute to the legacy of its namesakes and a substantial upgrade to our campus,” said JCT Vice President Stuart Hershkowitz. “This dormitory will be a special home for observant students who become trailblazers in their communities and exceptional contributors in their professional fields.” https://www.israelnationalnews.com/News/News.aspx/313751 share in social medias: Previous Update Next Update More Updates Where does Israel go from here?

JCT Graduation Ceremony Marks 30th Anniversary of Operation Solomon Home Page News and Updates ... JCT Graduation Ceremony Marks 30th Anniversary of Operation Solomon A graduation ceremony for the Jerusalem College of Technology (JCT) men's engineering degree took place in May which coincided with the 30th anniversary of Operation Solomon, a historic mission which brought over 4,000 Ethiopian Jews to Israel in 1991. In addition to the some 200 graduates and their families, JCT President Prof. Chaim Sukenik, Rector Prof. Kenneth Hochberg, Rabbi Yosef Zvi Rimon, Chairman of the Board of Trustees Dov Rubin, all attended the emotional event. Also present was Gashu Brihun, a software engineer for the Israeli Police and one of the first graduates of JCT’s Reuven Surkis Program for Students From the Ethiopian Community, which is dedicated to integrating Ethiopian Jews into Israeli society. JCT was the first academic institution in the country to establish a dedicated program aiming to help Ethiopians acclimate to Israel. In light of its success and the understanding that higher education is a critical tool to integrate populations, other universities and colleges have followed suit and offered similar programs with government support. \"There are a few key milestones in my absorption in the country and one of them is the fact that I studied computer engineering at JCT,\" said Brihun. \"I was able to combine studying both Torah and secular studies while learning from the best professors who ingrained within me the importance of persistence and determination.” Brihun was also fortunate to receive the goodwill of a benefactor who believed in his potential. “JCT introduced me to a donor who gave me a generous scholarship that enabled me to devote myself to studying in the Beit Midrash and in the academic track. I asked him why he was investing in me. He replied with a sentence that accompanies me to this day, ‘If I invest in you, you will invest and nurture future generations,’” he recalled. “Today I have the privilege to be a vital part of the Israeli Police Technology Department. In recent years, I've been a partner in the establishment of many software systems to support the different needs of the police force, and it's a great privilege for me to stand here and speak to the new graduates,\" he added. The program was named after its founder, Reuven Surkis, who also served as vice president of the Jerusalem College of Technology. \"The program is a direct way to integrate populations into society,\" Prof. Chaim Sukenik, president of JCT, said. \"The program enables integration into the job market and promotes social mobility. Reuven Surkis recognized this and worked hard to raise funds and donations so we could offer higher education to Ethiopian Israelis and Haredi students, as well as to allow them to devote time to their studies and not be preoccupied with needing to pay certain bills to make ends-meet. This event is an opportunity to thank him on behalf of our institution and its alumni.\" As for the significance of the anniversary of Operation Solomon, Brihun commented that “Operation Solomon is the end of a 2500-year-old exile, the end of longing and yearning for Jerusalem.” “Operation Solomon was made possible thanks to a speedy air operation by the Israeli Defense Forces that brought me along with four thousand other Jews to the land of Israel. The yearning to come home was deeply rooted in us. My father would tell me that one day we would go on a journey to Jerusalem and I should prepare myself. As a child, every time I saw an airplane, I would wave to it and call on it to take me to Jerusalem. I was privileged to fulfill my dream and to create a home and a family here in the Land of Israel,” he added. share in social medias: Previous Update Next Update More Updates Where does Israel go from here?

Orthodox women`s hackathon offers solutions for the elderly, abuse victims Home Page News and Updates ... Orthodox women's hackathon offers solutions for the elderly, abuse victims Over 130 religious and ultra-orthodox female students from Jerusalem College of Technology (JCT) took part in a 44-hour hackathon held by JCT's LevTech Entrepreneurship Center. First place in the hackathon was won by a team who designed technology that uses vision tech to detect when an elderly person falls, offering a solution to the nearly 25% of senior citizens in Israel who live alone. Third place was awarded to a team who used image processing to develop a system that would enable cameras in public places to detect a universal symbol for domestic abuse and alert authorities. The hand symbol was created in 2020 by the Canadian Women's Foundation and is meant to be used by whoever feels threatened but does not have regular contact with the outside world in order to report it. The hackathon took place in a hybrid model with most participants on-campus in Jerusalem and Ramat Gan. Others participated remotely from around Israel. “These women who participate in the hackathon are truly amazing,” said Orlee Guttman, co-founder of the LevTech Entrepreneurship Center. “Every year we become more impressed with the innovation and execution. We are excited to invite them to continue these wonderful ideas and turn them into products through our accelerator program.” “An incredible amount of creativity and mental fortitude was displayed at this hackathon,” said Dr. Shay Fleishon, CEO of the Jerusalem Development Authority's BioJerusalem Company. “The women approached the various challenges that arose with a high level of innovation and professionalism.” JCT is a college that focuses on science and technology and offers exclusive programs for ultra-Orthodox men and women and other demographics that may not otherwise be able to study science and technology. https://www.jpost.com/israel-news/orthodox-womens-hackathon-offers-solutions-for-the-elderly-abuse-victims-670179 share in social medias: Previous Update Next Update More Updates Where does Israel go from here?

Canadian Nurse to Become Youngest Israeli Nurse Practitioner Home Page News and Updates ... Canadian Nurse to become Youngest Israeli nurse practitioner Toronto-born student seeks to revamp geriatric care delivery 23 may 2021 The global pandemic has​ underscored​ the essential front line work of nurses and the vulnerability of senior citizens. Canadian-Israeli Shoshana Ratz is making her mark in both of these​ ​domains as the youngest soon-to-be graduate of the first Master’s degree program offered in Israel for geriatric nurse practitioners. Now a wife and mother of two, she made Aliyah from Toronto in 2011 and met her husband during her third year of the Jerusalem College of Technology program. More than 1,000 students annually are entered in the Bachelor of Science program and it has been ranked first among 24 nursing departments nationwide by the Israeli Ministry of Health. Having earned her BSC, she returned to JCT to pursue a Master’s Degree at its new Nurse Practitioner’s Program. (Interestingly, JCT has another unique connection to Toronto; in partnership with the U of T, JCT offers a unique program in health informatics, a relatively new field that bridges clinical, information, and communication technology expertise.) Ratz spoke with TheJ.ca about her college experience​, culture shock, and career ambitions​. What made you choose JCT’s nursing program? The program chose me. I was completing my pre-med studies in Canada [and] my mother told me about the JCT nursing program, which she had seen in an ad. During a summer in Israel, I met with Professor Chaya Greenberger, former dean of JCT’s Faculty of Health and Life Sciences… [she] invited me into her program, and I started in August 2010.” What were your initial impressions? The program was difficult, particularly because classes were taught entirely in Hebrew, but the professors were incredibly [supportive]. Many are English-speakers themselves, and they helped me to acclimate to this new style of learning. While I was very overwhelmed at first, I knew the program was right for me when I noticed the care and camaraderie of students and staff [who helped] me to adjust to new materials… [and] learn in a new language. If I lagged behind, [I knew] my classmates would ensure we collectively finished the work and would receive good grades together.” Did you personally experience the program’s growth? My first year was JCT’s fourth year of the program, so there was no real indicator of fellow alums’ success. When I began, I felt the school was actively trying to prove itself; it was a fledgling program without much of a track record. At times, [people from] other programs would say, ‘JCT’s not even a university,’ but we had the last laugh in the end. Every student from that first year passed the Government Licensing Exam with the highest average of any Israeli university. Suddenly we were on the map. How did JCT prepare you for life in Israel, if at all? Going to an Israeli college “straight off the plane” prepared me for the culture shock and language barrier all new immigrants are destined to face. If I chose to attend a non-Israeli college, it would have been harder to acclimate to Israeli society and to my current job. If somebody wants to make Aliyah, I recommend they go to an Israeli college. I believe JCT is the best place to go because they have a kind, English-speaking staff, they respect your background, and encourage you to learn in Hebrew while utilizing your English skills as an advantage. I could never have imagined my journey would lead me here. But now I would not want it any other way. What are your career aspirations? I’ve decided to go into geriatrics as there is a dire need for geriatric nurses. I completed a specialty in a joint geriatric ICU program and the new Master of Science/Nurse Practitioner Program in Geriatrics. My goal is to change the way we treat our elderly within the health system. As a nurse practitioner, I feel qualified to make the greatest impact since I understand both aspects of the patient — the care and the value of relationships with patients, in addition to the importance of medicine and research. https://thej.ca/2020/07/15/canadian-to-become-youngest-israeli-nurse-practitioner/ share in social medias: Previous Update Next Update More Updates Where does Israel go from here?

Adi Yonas: empowering Ethiopian immigrants to advance in Israeli society Home Page News and Updates ... Adi's story The story of Adi Yonas embodies the immigrant dream of socioeconomic mobility. april 2021 Yonas arrived in Israel following a long and arduous journey from Ethiopia, vi a Sudan, largely by foot. Along the way, he endured imprisonment, bandits’ attacks, and disease, all of which claimed the lives of many of his fellow aspiring immigrants. Yet in January 1985, Yonas and his family boarded the final aircraft leaving Sudan as part of Operation Moses, a covert evacuation of Ethiopian Jews to Israel which involved collaboration between the Israel Defense Forces, the Central Intelligence Agency, the U.S. embassy in Khartoum, and Sudanese state security forces. Two decades later, Yonas graduated with a degree in computer science from the Reuven Surkis Program for Students from the Ethiopian Community at the Jerusalem College of Technology (JCT), and in 2005 assumed the role of coordinator of that same academic program — a position he still holds today. “As immigrants from Ethiopia, adjusting in terms of language and mentality was not easy,” Yonas told Arutz Sheva. “But the expectation and longing to reach Israel, and the motivation to learn the Hebrew language and live as everyone else does in the country, helped us not make any concessions as we pursued integration and upward mobility in our new homeland.” The journey Back in Ethiopia, Yonas recalls that when residents of his Jewish village became aware of the possibility of reaching Israel, they sold all of their belongings and promptly left — only to immediately encounter the Ethiopian military. “We departed the village on a Saturday morning so that the army wouldn’t sense that we were leaving,” he told the Israeli media outlet. “We reached the parking lot near a well, drank, ate, and began our journey. We were about 50 people. My father was the first to leave the parking lot with my grandmother next to him, riding a horse. Out of nowhere, a truck loaded with soldiers arrived, having heard that we were leaving. They beat my father with the end of a gun. As an 11-year-old child, I didn’t know where to place myself. The children in our group were loaded to a truck and the adults were taken by foot. The soldiers arrested the adults in chains near Gondar and placed the children in a house. We were there for two weeks.” The adults, however, proceeded to convince the authorities that they had no intention of leaving Ethiopia. “We had a cover story that we were relocating inside Ethiopia,” Yonas added. “We had commanders in the area who spoke on our behalf, because cousins of ours had served in the army.” Once set free, the group began its trek by foot to Sudan, which lasted several weeks and was led by guides. But their guides betrayed them. “The crossing from Ethiopia to Sudan required that we exchange Ethiopian money for Sudanese money, a service provided by our guides. This way, our guides found out who in the group had money with them. After we had walked for a few hours, bandits assaulted us,” he says. The group separated from the guides and moved into Sudan, eventually arriving at a refugee camp where each tent housed 30–40 people. “As we were all crowded together, the malaria disease spread quickly and caused people to die, one by one. It started with the kids. I had a sister who was a few months old when we arrived in Sudan and she contracted the disease, just like my other siblings,” Yonas also relayed to Arutz Sheva. After moving from one place to another in Sudan, the group finally discovered that the immigration operation to Israel had begun. Promoting socioeconomic mobility Today, Yonas has come full circle. In his capacity at JCT, he works to ensure that the current generation of young Ethiopian immigrant men and women can attain the same advancement that he has experienced in Israeli society. The program empowers them to improve their lives by enabling them to earn an academic degree and pursue careers in high-tech, business, and the military. Dedicated to promoting socioeconomic mobility, JCT was one of the first Israeli institutions of higher education to offer specialized programs for the Ethiopian community in the fields of science and engineering. As a result of cultural difference, many potential students from Ethiopian backgrounds lack a strong academic foundation in STEM (science, technology, engineering, and math) subjects and do not have adequate matriculation scores to directly enter JCT’s academic programs. Often, they are part of the first generation in their families to pursue studies at a higher education institution. Accordingly, JCT offers a one-year, intensive pre-academic preparatory program to advance their academic skills and knowledge of math, English, and physics. This track also features a mentorship program that offers new students an opportunity to study with 4th-year students. To date, more than 50 percent of students from the Reuven Surkis Program have gone on to pursue graduate studies, and virtually all program participants secure employment in their field of choice. The current group of Ethiopian students at JCT includes Itai (formerly named Mengistu in Ethiopia), who immigrated to Israel last year. “The education at JCT is beyond my expectations…it is much harder than the coursework in Ethiopia,” says Itai. “Only smart kids can survive here.” After experiencing difficulty maintaining an observant Jewish lifestyle in a collegiate environment in Ethiopia, Itai says he is elated “to be living in the heart of Jerusalem and studying at a college where Jewish studies is as critically important as the secular academics. It’s just incredible how fast things can change. The college I went to in Ethiopia had around 20,000 students, and only a few of them knew I was Jewish.” ‘A big brother’ JCT provides Ethiopian students with free tuition and board, free tutoring, and bus fare to go home on weekends, among other benefits. Stuart Hershkowitz, the College’s vice president, calls Yonas “a big brother to the students,” especially because he graduated from the same program. “We have an extremely low dropout rate, and our Ethiopian graduates have a 100-percent placement record in their chosen professions, which is unusual. They’re very serious students,” Hershkowitz told Israel 21C, adding, “This has nothing to do with affirmative action. There are no breaks for Ethiopians at all.” Yonas praises the State of Israel for “doing many things for the Ethiopian community.” Ethiopian immigrants typically spend their first six months in the country living in an absorption center, where they receive subsidized temporary housing and Hebrew-language instruction. At the same time, Yonas notes the challenges of the immigrant absorption process. “Instead of being distributed throughout society, new immigrants are concentrated with each other in places where they don’t have any native Israelis to learn from,” he says. “In order to learn and succeed, you need to meet and interact with other communities in an open space.” And that, according to Yonas, is precisely the need filled by the Reuven Surkis Program. “Even students with a lot of potential cannot do well if they have the worries of putting food on the table,” Yonas says. “The financial, social, and academic support makes all the difference.” share in social medias: Previous Update Next Update More Updates Where does Israel go from here?

Industrial engineering student receives Jerusalem College of Technology’s annual scholarship named after female trailblazer Home Page News and Updates ... Rosalie Schechter - atara Benovitz Atara Benovitz awarded $3,000 towards tuition at JCT’s Tal Campus as recipient of scholarship established in memory of Dr. Rozalie Schachter, former General Microwave Corporation executive. april 2021 The Jerusalem College of Technology (JCT), a leader in providing high-level science and technology education to religiously observant students in Israel and worldwide, have announced the 2021 recipient of an annual scholarship for outstanding computer or engineering students. Atara Benovitz, 21, a third-year industrial engineering student at JCT’s Tal Campus for women, is the third recipient of the Rozalie Schachter Scholarship. Launched in 2019, the $3,000 scholarship towards tuition fees is being awarded to one Tal Campus student through 2028. Eligible recipients are students who achieve an average score of over 90 in their studies. The prize is named after the late Dr. Rozalie Schachter, the daughter of Satmar Chassidim, who immigrated to the U.S. from Romania at age 16, obtained a Ph.D. in Physics from New York University (NYU), and became a trailblazer for women in the fields of technology and business. Schachter served as vice president of strategic initiatives at Herley Industries and vice president of business development at General Microwave Corporation, among other senior roles. Benovitz — a native of Woodmere, N.Y., whose family made Aliyah to Beit Shemesh early in her life — was drawn to JCT by the institution’s religiously sensitive environment on campus, and particularly the ability to study on an all-women’s campus. Benovitz said she is fascinated by the field of aviation, which is a common profession for industrial engineers, but as of now is keeping her career options open. “Receiving this scholarship motivates me to take my studies to the next level and prove that I am worthy of the award,” said Benovitz. “The support will help set me up for success not only in my career, but in my entire adult life in Israel, where average salaries in most fields are lower than they are in the U.S. I am also grateful for the opportunity to study at the Tal Campus, where my professors are highly approachable and promote my growth. Thanks to my JCT experience, I am extremely hopeful for my future in Israel’s society and workforce.” When Schachter settled in Brooklyn upon moving to America, she studied at the Beis Yaakov school for girls in Borough Park and became interested in the fields of science and math. When she finished high school, the Satmar Rebbe gave her a blessing to attend college in order to follow her dreams in physics and the sciences. In the 1960s, her completion of a Ph.D. in solid-state physics at NYU was considered an anomaly not only for an Orthodox Jewish woman with children, but for all American women at the time. “The annual Rozalie Schachter Scholarship represents a key manifestation of JCT’s mission to empower women and all students to embark on a balanced, well-rounded lifestyle that is guided by their Jewish, family, and career values,” said JCT board member and President emeritus Aurora Cassirer. “Rozalie uniquely pursued this ambitious path, holding herself to a standard of excellence in all areas of life. She continues to serve as an inspiration to the outstanding students at our Tal Campus.” Established in 1990, JCT’s Tal Campus is Israel’s first women-only engineering and technology college. The campus serves approximately 2,000 women from across the spectrum of the religiously observant community, including Modern Orthodox, National Religious, Haredi, and Hassidic women. The Tal Campus provides women the opportunity to pursue advanced undergraduate or graduate studies alongside a comprehensive Jewish studies program. JCT is about to embark on the construction of the new Tal Campus, which will be located in Emek Zion, adjacent to the College’s Lev Campus for men. Currently, the Tal Campus is housed in rented space in Jerusalem’s Givat Shaul neighborhood and is unable to accommodate JCT’s surging demand for women’s enrollment. The new state-of-the-art women’s campus will house the College’s Nursing School as well as Departments of Computer Engineering, Electro-Optic Engineering, Industrial Engineering, Accounting, Management, and Business. The campus will also include the institution’s pre-academic (mechina) program and graduate programs. Tal Campus alumni have a job placement rate of over 90 percent in their field of study and are readily employed by leading firms and startups such as Intel, Texas Instruments, Check Point, and IBM, among others. Following their studies, many graduates continue to pursue advanced academic careers and others are involved in top R&D projects for Israel’s defense industry. share in social medias: Previous Update Next Update More Updates Where does Israel go from here?

Israeli Ministry of Health Awards Jerusalem College of Technology Nursing Instructor for Outstanding Contributions During Pandemic Home Page News and Updates ... Chedva Levin Israeli Ministry of Health Awards Jerusalem College of Technology Nursing Instructor for Outstanding Contributions During Pandemic 29 April 2021 Dr. Chedva Levin, who is slated to head JCT’s new Internal Medicine track, moved to Sheba Medical Center’s intensive care unit to treat dozens of urgent COVID-19 cases on a daily basis Jerusalem, April, 2021 — Dr. Chedva Levin, a leading instructor in Internal Medicine at the Jerusalem College of Technology’s (JCT) Department of Nursing and an intensive care nurse at Sheba Medical Center, is among the recipients of a newly announced award from Israel’s Ministry of Health that recognizes health professionals’ outstanding contributions during the COVID-19 pandemic. The award ceremony will take place on May 12, which coincides with International Nurses Day. Levin, a mother of six who lives in Talmon, was temporarily moved to the intensive care unit (ICU) from her usual position in Sheba’s vascular surgery department due to the surge in urgent COVID-19 cases. On a daily basis in the ICU, she treated dozens of patients, including many who needed to be placed on ventilators and ECMO machines. At JCT, Levin is slated to head the nursing program’s new master’s track in Internal Medicine, which is designed for nurses with a bachelor’s degree who work in hospital departments of neurology, respiratory medicine, intensive care, infectious diseases, and others. Internal medicine has taken on unprecedented importance during the pandemic, as rising demand for specialist care to treat patients with complex illness has caused the overcrowding of internal medicine wards. Further, many coronavirus patients who arrive at the hospital who are in moderate or mild condition already have other illnesses, which can cause their condition to rapidly deteriorate. Accordingly, hospitals have substantial need for nurses who possess the varied knowledge and skill set of an internal medicine background, which equips them to assess and care for those with complicated illness. “Dr. Chedva Levin has displayed the utmost professionalism and dedication to her patients at Sheba Medical Center as well as her students at JCT, who represent an important part of the future generation of Israel’s health care system,” said Prof. Freda Ganz, Dean of JCT’s Faculty of Life and Health Sciences. “We take tremendous pride in Dr. Levin and in the various other JCT students, alumni, and faculty who have mobilized to fight COVID-19, day and night.” When the Israeli Health Ministry asked nursing schools across the country to train their students in care of COVID-19 patients in March 2020, JCT swiftly answered the call by training 600 third- and fourth-year nursing students within a week. The following month, more than 30 JCT nursing students started training in nursing homes nationwide.

Jerusalem College of Technology partners with McLean Hospital to reduce stigma around mental illness Home Page News and Updates ... Deconstructing Stigma JCT faculty, staff, and students to participate in Israeli iteration of U.S.-based Deconstructing Stigma campaign, which showcases complexity of living with mental illness. 2 feb 2021 JCT faculty, staff, and students will localize and adapt McLean’s award-winning campaign, Deconstructing Stigma: Changing Attitudes About Mental Health , which uses a series of larger-than-life photographs and interviews in order to debunk the misconceptions about those who live with mental illness, including the complexities surrounding seeking treatment, navigating insurance and healthcare systems, and facing stigma. The JCT iteration of Deconstructing Stigma will be carried out over the course of a full academic year by a class of 30 fourth-year nursing students from Ofek, JCT’s special track for Haredi female students. These students were chosen for the campaign with the hope of making them agents of change in Israeli society. Participating students will study theories and research regarding the stigmatization associated with mental health issues, conduct meetings and conversations with people from varied backgrounds who have been affected by mental illness, identify community members from diverse backgrounds to share their stories for the campaign, plan and design the campaign with the community members, find potential sites to present the installations, and create and promote the installations. The installations will appear on JCT’s campuses and in different neighborhoods around Jerusalem. Further, the JCT students will carry out a research project in collaboration with Prof. David H. Rosmarin from Harvard Medical School and McLean Hospital and Prof. Steven Tzvi Pirutinsky from Touro College. The students will work in groups under the guidance of Dr. Zvika Orr, receiving training on methodologies, reviewing literature, formulating research questions and hypotheses, data gathering and analysis, drawing conclusions, and preparing a research report. The project will aim to study the campaign's impact on the lives of the participants who share their stories, as well as on the attitudes of JCT's students and staff toward mental illness. JCT’s past experience in this space derives largely from Lev Bakehila Community Project , the College’s flagship civic engagement program. Founded in 2015, the program enables JCT students, faculty, and staff to promote the rights of people with disabilities in areas such as housing, education, employment, accessibility, due process, and equality. “First and foremost, we are immensely proud of our nursing students, who continue to pioneer medical breakthroughs across the country. Implementing the Deconstructing Stigma campaign, the first-of-its-kind in Israel, strongly reflects the College’s longtime track record of empowering underserved populations and contributing to the overall betterment of society,” said JCT President Prof. Chaim Sukenik. “We are gratified to collaborate with such world-renowned partners in using this creative platform for the purpose of eradicating the stigma surrounding mental illness in Israel.” The seeds of the new partnership were planted in December 2019, when McLean’s representatives and their partner in Israel: OGEN - Association for the Advancement of Mental Health, visited JCT and consequently decided to collaborate in localizing and implementing the Deconstructing Stigma campaign in Israel in 2020-21, and to conduct collaborative research on the impact of the localized campaign. OGEN and its chairman Stuart Katz play a crucial role in this campaign. Since Deconstructing Stigma’s initial physical installation at Boston’s Logan International Airport , the campaign has traveled the world with pop-up installations across the U.S. and in all inhabited continents except Australia. The campaign states that the people with mental illness who are featured in its stories “are more than just statistics or nameless faces. They are mothers, fathers, wives, husbands, lawyers, doctors, engineers, musicians, and more. Each one has been affected by mental illness, and each one has also faced stigma.” share in social medias: Previous Update Next Update More Updates Where does Israel go from here?

Lev Bakehila Community Project Lev Bakehila: JCT's flagship community engagement project for the promotion of human rights for persons with disabilities in the Haredi community of Jerusalem. Home Page Community Projects ... About the Lev Bakehila Project About the Lev Bakehila Project Goals JCT's Policy Partner organizations Background In Jerusalem there are between 27,000 and 50,000 Haredi (ultra-orthodox) people with varying degrees of disability. This group includes people with physical, mental, sensory, developmental, and cognitive disabilities who are, therefore, doubly discriminated against by Israeli society. For example, Haredi people with disabilities have higher unemployment rates and greater economic difficulties both in comparison to Haredim who are not disabled and to the secular population with disabilities (Alfassi-Henley, 2014). In addition, there is a serious lack of information regarding their rights and the services in place to assist them which is partly due to poor access to information on the internet and other media. Similarly to people with disabilities from other sectors, members of the Haredi sector with disabilities often experience stigma and shame. This flagship community engagement project of the Jerusalem College of Technology (JCT) – Lev Academic Center was established in the spirit of \"the social model of disability\" that views people with disabilities as having a unique contribution to society and seeks to do everything possible to enable them to fulfill this contribution for their benefit, and, no less importantly, for the benefit of all of society. Project Description Students participating in the project promote the rights of Haredi people with disabilities, their integration as equals into society, and their empowerment. 130 students from all JCT’s campuses, including students from the Haredi community and students with disabilities, participate in the project. The project is run by the Department of Nursing but is open to students from all departments at JCT, studying towards bachelor's as well as master's degrees. The students' activities in the community include four hours each week throughout the academic year. Students participating in the project receive a scholarship as well as a certificate acknowledging their participation in the flagship program. In the early months of the year, students attend training that combines practical-professional aspects, such as information regarding human rights in general and the rights of people with disabilities in particular, as well as theoretical-academic aspects, such as basic concepts of disability studies. The training is provided by academic and professional experts (lawyers, social workers, etc.). During the year, additional training on specific topics adapted to the needs of students in the field is carried out. Upon completion of the training, the students select one of following: Individual Level – advancing knowledge and awareness of rights among people with disabilities, their families and their caregivers, guidance and accompaniment in enacting their rights, and their empowerment. Some of the students deal with short-term inquiries while others accompany people and families with multiple needs over a long period of time providing them with in-depth assistance in order to achieve a significant and sustainable change in their lives. Community Level – creating community projects that address a need that arises from the community. For example, students identified the need to work with sisters of children with disabilities in a Haredi neighborhood and established a group of sisters with whom they have worked for over a year now. Public Policy Level – activities to alter policies or to create new policies, on both the municipal and national levels, particularly on topics that arise from those dealing with the individual and community levels. On each level, the students can choose between one of two tracks. In the first track, the students can volunteer with civil society organizations that partner with the project (for more details, see under “Partner Organizations”). In the second track, students volunteer in the “Lev Bakehilla” Citizens Rights Center. The Center’s mission is to help Haredi people with disabilities familiarize themselves with and realize their rights. This innovative Rights Center was established in collaboration with the Ezer Mizion Organization’s Family Counseling Center . The Rights Center was established as a result of an in-depth study conducted by the students, under the supervision of the project faculty. Their study used interviews to examine the needs of Haredi people with disabilities and their families, their level of knowledge about their rights, the degree to which they have realized their rights, and the best ways to address their needs and help them promote their rights. The students who volunteer at the Rights Center undergo a comprehensive training by experts in each of its issue areas. The Right Center addresses a wide range of issue areas, including housing, education, employment, accessibility, health services, welfare, due process, equality and more. The Center provides services to people with all kinds of disabilities, free of charge. The student volunteers have an entire network of experts from ten non-governmental and municipal organizations (lawyers, social workers, and others) who advise the students in how to help their clients. To the Rights Center's flyer and contact info, click here. In light of studies that indicate the importance of discussion groups for students, regular group meetings are held for volunteers, where they discuss professional, emotional, and ethical dilemmas that arise from operating activities. The meetings allow reflection and group discussion on the work, the challenges it poses, as well as the benefits and opportunities that arise from it. These meetings also help connect the three levels of activity and the students working within them. The training and group sessions allow to put the students’ activism in the broader social, structural, cultural, economic, and political contexts. The flagship project was built for the long term, taking into consideration the importance of a profound and ongoing relationship with the community and long-term continuous social activism of students and staff together with the community. The project is accompanied by a comprehensive evaluation study, which helps develop the project in an effective manner and to maximize the contribution of the project to all those who participate. The evaluation study is based on a written survey, interviews, and observations. Some nursing students participate in a seminar on health, disability, and human rights. This community-engaged seminar deals with social and cultural aspects of disability and their connection with human rights issues. The seminar is given by Dr. Zvika Orr and Dr. Adi Finkelstein. During the seminar, the students map and analyze social realities relating to the lives of people with disabilities from the Haredi community. The project is generously supported by the Council for Higher Education, PERACH, and (in 2018) the Jewish Community Foundation of Greater MetroWest, NJ.

Goals About the Lev Bakehila Project Goals JCT's Policy Partner organizations Short-term goals and planning - Assistance to approximately 500 Haredim with disabilities in exercising their rights, providing knowledge about their rights and empowerment. - Year-round extensive guidance for approximately 15 families/people with disabilities from the Haredi sector and increasing their options for living independently and comfortably. - Initiating and implementing a community project with the participation of more than 50 people from the community. - Working towards policy change, which can benefit a large group of Haredi people with disabilities in Jerusalem. - Establishing and strengthening the \"Rights Center\" as a recognized and accepted service provider for the ultra-Orthodox community, in cooperation with organizations working in the field. - Significant contribution to volunteering students: providing knowledge and relevant experience, creating commitment to social contribution, and strengthening civic responsibility. - For many of the students, this is their first opportunity to meet a group in society, which they would otherwise not have been exposed to, and strengthening a sense of solidarity with \"the Other\". - Raising awareness of people with disabilities (rights, integration, contribution etc.) among the Haredi community in Jerusalem, the public at large, the relevant municipal and national authorities, and all students and staff of JCT. Long-term goals and planning - Creating a stable, well-established, professional, effective framework for long-term activity, recognized and appreciated by the community, supported by all partners in the process, with consistent activity of students over several years, maintaining continuous operations even during the summer months. - Expanding activists among the students and the community, creating a group of community volunteers, trained by the students, who will volunteer together with the students. - Creating a framework for peer counseling - we conducted a preliminary survey that showed that although the need for this service is decreasing in the general population due to widespread access to information on the Internet, this service will be extremely beneficial to members of the Haredi community, especially with respect to mediation with service providers. - Benefit to students - based on the findings of several studies, we expect that participation in the project will have a positive impact on academic achievement, leadership skills and self-confidence of the students, will raise their motivation to continue studying for advanced degrees, will enhance their chances to succeed in the workforce and enhance their sense of obligation to actively take action for social justice. - Highlighting the links between Judaism and human rights. - Increasing the discourse regarding human rights of persons with disabilities in Israeli society in general and in Haredi society in particular. - Strengthening connections and mutual support between the Jerusalem College of Technology and the ultra-Orthodox community in Jerusalem. - Promoting knowledge and research in the field of disabilities, specifically in relation to the Haredi community.

However students should check with specific colleges as each has different requirements for transfer credits. Questions? JCT's Policy Home Page Community Projects ... JCT's Policy About the Lev Bakehila Project Goals JCT's Policy Partner organizations The project in the Jerusalem College of Technology's policy The Jerusalem College of Technology decided to consolidate and strengthen the social involvement and active civic participation of students and faculty, and to promote the mutual support between the institution and the community. As an academic-religious institution, the Jerusalem College of Technology wishes to exercise the Jewish values ​​of justice, mercy, \"Love your neighbor as yourself\" and Tikkun Olam (repairing the world). \"On three things the world stands: Torah, work and charity\" (Pirke Avot, FFA MB). We believe that it is our duty as an academic-religious institution not only to provide excellent higher education and religious studies, but also to fulfill our responsibility towards society and create an inherent connection between these elements. The Department of Nursing, leading this flagship project, seeks to realize these values in its academic and practical activities. This project’s activism sharpens the social sensitivity of the nursing students, who play a significant part in this project, and exposes them to issues that are most relevant to their future work. We believe that they can serve as messengers in the future, spreading knowledge and sensitivity in relation to the rights of people with disabilities among health professionals as well as various health institutions in Jerusalem (hospitals, community clinics, etc.). It should be noted that the community engagement is in the area of ​​current research of several faculty members in the Department of Nursing. This allows for maximum utilization of academic resources, enabling high-quality training as well as in-depth and informed social volunteerism, with a broad, comparative and critical perspective. This project is also paramount for the promotion of Haredi society in Israel. The academic education of the Haredi community, men and women, and their entrance into the workforce is one of the central challenges facing contemporary Israel. For 50 years, JCT’s religious environment and its focus on professional career development have attracted orthodox youth interested in studying for an academic degree. Now, the Haredi students are coming to JCT where they are being assisted in becoming contributing members of society as scientists and engineers, in high-tech and in business. In addition, this flagship project enables Haredi students to contribute directly to their community in novel ways. This strengthens the connection between their socio-cultural world and the world of academic studies and employment that they have joined. Participation in the flagship project also provides them with valuable practical experience and strengthens their qualities and skills such as leadership, self-confidence, and motivation. For non-Haredi students, this program provides them with the opportunity to deepen their knowledge of Haredi society and strengthen solidarity among the various groups that make up the Jerusalem College of Technology. The focus of the flagship project in the field of human rights of persons with disabilities also complements the institution's policy, which sets for itself the goal of absorbing and integrating people with disabilities as students, faculty, and staff at the institution and promoting innovative research in the field. We believe, therefore, that the project \"Lev Bakehila\" realizes the values, goals, and vision of the Jerusalem College of Technology.

Spotlight on a student Effie Mincer immigrated to Israel on August 16 and plans to complete an industrial engineering degree at the Jerusalem College of Technology 23/10/20 Toronto native Effie Mincer describes being in Israel for the back-to-back national observances of Yom Hazikaron (Memorial Day for fallen soldiers and victims of terror) and Yom Haatzmaut (Independence Day) as a “life-changing” experience. “We’ve always had ceremonies at school to commemorate those days and what they stand for, but I’ve never fully understood what it was all about until I was in Israel two years ago during my gap year in Yeshiva,” says Mincer, 20. “Visiting the graves of those who’ve fought and died for our country shook me to my core. I’ve never truly understood the immense sacrifices that have been made in order for us to have the modern state of Israel. And only after understanding and internalizing all that loss, can you truly celebrate the next day, realizing how lucky we are to have the state of Israel as it is today.” On August 16, Mincer had another life-changing experience, this time with concrete implications: He made Aliyah (immigration to Israel) with Nefesh B’Nefesh. Currently a madrich (guide) at Yeshivat Aish Hatorah in Jerusalem, he plans to complete an industrial engineering degree at the Jerusalem College of Technology (JCT) within the next five years.

JCT Conference Examining Intersection Between Health and Religious Lifestyle Home Page News and Updates ... Nursing conference The Nursing Department held a virtual conference last week which examined the relationship between health and a religious lifestyle during both normal times and the current crisis revolving around the pandemic. 14/9/2020 The Nursing Department of Lev Academic Center held yesterday an online Health Conference in which studies on the relationship between health and a religious life style – during regular times and during the current crisis - were presented. MK Moshe Abutbul also participated in the conference and criticized the state’s conduct with the Haredi Sector in relation to the virus. In the forum that discussed the role of community rabbis, Rabbi Benjamin Goldschmidt, of the East Park Community of Manhattan, shared his for personal coping with the needs of the Jewish community in New York in light of the situation. \"Manhattan is built in such a way that you sense the material world as the eternal world, and then comes COVID and everything stopped,\" said Rabbi Goldschmidt. \"It started slowly with the shuttering of businesses, which led to the closure of the city and continued with horrific mortality rates of hundreds of people dying every day. Manhattan hospitals, which are considered the leaders in the world, collapsed from being overloaded. There is not one person who doesn't know someone who passed away or who has at least one family member who was hospitalized because of complications related to COVID.\" Rabbi Goldschmidt also addressed the difficulty in dealing with many Jewish dead bodies, under the guidelines of social distancing and the concern of further spreading of the disease. \"As a community rabbi, I found myself burying Jews alone. Funerals without the presence of close family members who simply were unable to come and say Kaddish. It is a personal trauma that I will always carry with me,\" he lamented. Moreover, he explained that \"the difficult economic turbulence caused many families to remove their children from private Jewish education frameworks due to high tuition costs, while others moved to suburbs so that they can continue to finance their children’s Jewish education. Plans for making Aliyah became more frequent, with many families getting ready accordingly. This created a trend that resulted in Jewish schools losing approximately 20% of their students. The only consolation is that some of those who left the community, will immigrate to Israel.\" However, Rabbi Yosef Zvi Rimon, the Rabbinic Head of the Jerusalem College of Technology and its Beit Midrash, said that even a tragedy of this magnitude has a silver lining. During the conference, Rabbi Rimon spoke about the positive aspects resulting from COVID. \"On the day after COVID, we will be better people. We will see what we learned from this difficult period and what we will take with us for the future,” he said. ”There are disabled and elderly populations who suffer from the isolation regardless of the epidemic. We have developed sensitiveness, compassion and awareness toward underserved populations who were under our radar before the pandemic hit.\" JCT’s Religiosity, Health and COVID conference was the first of its kind and featured several other high-profile figures. MK Moshe Abutbul, for example, criticized the state’s conduct with the Haredi sector in relation to the virus, while Dr. Ronit Pinhas-Mizrachi, a lecturer at the Israel Academic College in Ramat Gan, examined the differences in awareness towards health, in populations of different religious levels. Additionally, Dr. Chaya Raz, head of JCT’s Nursing Department, spoke about students’ cognitive dissonance when it comes to COVID restrictions in accordance with their religious level. Meanwhile, Dr. Zvika Orr, Senior Lecturer in the Faculty of Life and Health Sciences at the Jerusalem College of Technology, presented research about the social involvement of Haredi students and Dr. Ahuva Spitz, head of the men’s Nursing Department, discussed health-related decision making. Dr. Anat Romem, head of Nursing Graduate Program at JCT, discussed the changes seen in pashkevilim (posters situated on a public wall in a Haredi community) during COVID. Finally, another study presented by Dr. Adi Finkelstein, a member of JCT’s nursing department, discussed promoting healthy living in Haredi communities. The study was co-sponsored with the Women’s Health Center For You and Hadassah Ein Kerem. share in social medias: Previous Update Next Update More Updates Where does Israel go from here?

JCT Researcher Participates in Groundbreaking Brain Imaging Research at Cornell Home Page News and Updates ... Dr David Sinefeld Dr. David Sinefeld along with his Cornell University counterparts reveal new method for brain imaging in zebrafish, potentially providing great insight into future brain discoveries 26/10/20 Israeli researcher and Jerusalem College of Technology professor Dr. David Sinefeld and a group of interdisciplinary scientists at Cornell University have made a new breakthrough in brain imaging thanks to its mapping of a zebrafish’s brain. The team, working in the university’s labs, used advanced microscopy methods in order to image the fine structure and activity of an adult zebrafish brain which resulted in opening a new horizon of neurological research. “This is a problem that everyone dreams of solving,” Dr. Sinefeld said, referring to the difficulty in successfully examining thick brain tissue, especially through adult fish scales. Experimenting on zebrafish is a useful stepping-stone to understanding the human brain because all vertebrate brains are similar in nature. Although scientists usually use mice and monkeys as models for the human brain, zebrafish are another viable option. “All vertebrate brains are, to a first approximation, the same, with nearly all brain regions [present] in nearly every vertebrate,” said Joseph Fetcho , professor of neurobiology and behavior and director of Cornell Neurotech in the College of Arts and Sciences told the Cornell Chronicle . “This is not surprising because they all, even the simplest ones, have to do the same things to survive and reproduce.” “In order to solve this problem, we used a novel microscopy method which was invented in Prof. Chris Xu lab [at Cornell]. In this method, we use special lasers with extremely short pulses which interacts with the molecules in the brain in a way that allows to separate between this interaction and the scattered light from other tissue layers. This means that we can shine a laser beam through fish scales, and still see the neurons behind them, allowing us to image specific neurons deep in the brain with very high resolution,” said Dr. Sinefeld, who spent five years working as a postdoctoral researcher Mong Fellow at Cornell Neurotech center. The innovative, precise method delivers 1300nm wavelength photons to a certain point in the brain, activating a specific fluorescent protein. The laser then repeatedly scans a certain section of the brain, garnering a three-dimensional image of its structure. To date, all other methods of looking inside the brain - like an MRI - don’t yield the resolution needed to see the neurons and structure inside. “This method opens a new horizon for animal brain research. We can now see better how the brain works,” Dr. Sinefeld added. “This research allows us to monitor a full zebrafish brain over time. For instance, after applying this tool to fish engineered to have certain brain disorders the images can then decipher how the brain changes as the fish mature. Likewise, the images can then also see how the fish respond to treatment over time and can lead to dramatic implications in how we understand brain functions and their disorders.” Dr. Sinefeld hopes to continue his efforts in the field of microscopy at the Jerusalem College of Technology (JCT) and is in the process of applying for grants and funding to build a new lab dedicated to this discipline at the school. “This could be a game-changer in the field of neuroscience. I am excited for the opportunity to establish these novel methods In Israel and specifically in JCT,” he said.

Jerusalem Minister Rafi Peretz visits future women’s campus Home Page News and Updates ... Perez visit Lauds project’s promise to empower diverse populations. 10/6/2020 Israel’s Minister of Jerusalem Affairs and National Projects Rabbi Rafi Peretz (Jewish Home) on Tuesday visited the Jerusalem College of Technology (JCT) and the site for its forthcoming Tal Campus for Women: a 30,000-square-foot (2,787.1-square-meter) campus that is poised to become one of Jerusalem’s most important capital projects over the next five years. The new Tal Campus is slated as the permanent home for up to 3,000 of JCT’s female students in nursing, computer science, electro-optics, industrial engineering, accounting, and management. The campus will provide increased opportunities for Religious Zionist, haredi, and Ethiopian women to pursue higher education and attain quality employment in Jerusalem’s high-tech industries. The project is part of the vision JCT shares with the Israeli government to strengthen Jerusalem as Israel’s academic capital, enabling members of all sectors to integrate into the workforce, contribute to its economy, and become highly skilled and professional leaders of Israel’s rapidly advancing technology, science, and health fields. “The development of the Tal Campus is especially important for empowering diverse populations, including religious and haredi women, through higher education. This ambition aligns with my ministry’s top strategic priorities,” Peretz said. “The current, temporary Tal Campus does not provide the proper environment to allow religious women to study and then integrate into Israel’s employment market. Given the need to build a dedicated and high-quality campus for these women, I am looking at different ways to support the construction of the Tal Campus in the coming year.” Built in Givat Mordechai and adjacent to JCT’s existing Lev Campus for Men, major transportation routes, and the new southern entrance to Jerusalem, the state-of-the-art women’s campus is being designed by the award-winning architectural firm Kimmel Eshkolot Architects. “Over the years, many courses of study have been added to the current Tal Campus, along with a significant and consistent increase in enrolled students,” JCT President Prof. Chaim Sukenik said. “These trends, in addition to Israel’s rising workforce needs in high-tech and healthcare, necessitate the construction of an innovative women’s campus just like the one we are building. Given that a significant percentage of our female students choose to live and work in Jerusalem following graduation, the establishment of the new Tal Campus is of paramount importance for Jerusalem’s future. We sincerely thank Minister Rafi Peretz as well as the Jerusalem Development Authority for their willingness to support and assist this initiative.” https://www.israelnationalnews.com/News/News.aspx/281639 share in social medias: Previous Update Next Update More Updates Where does Israel go from here?

Nurses-in-training enlisted to help with coronavirus pandemic Home Page News and Updates ... Nursing Corona Jerusalem College of Technology answers Health Ministry's call to provide training for 600 nursing students in respiratory care services, as the healthcare system deals with thousands of patients. 30/3/2020 Link to full article in Yisrael Hayom Given the anticipated manpower shortage of hospital staff able to treat those infected with COVID-19 disease caused by the coronavirus, the Health Ministry has asked nursing schools across Israel to step up and train their students in respiratory care. Answering the call, some 600 third- and fourth-year nursing students from the Jerusalem College of Technology's five campuses were trained within a week. Heeding the urgent request of the ministry's director of nursing, the goal was to train a therapeutic team that can provide treatment to corona patients in need of respiratory support should medical personnel be forced to go into isolation or if there is an extreme influx of patients requiring additional manpower. In order to prevent more infections within hospitals, the course was conducted online. \"The nursing students at Machon Lev, Mivhar, Shaare Zedek Medical Center and Machon Tal embody the overall spirit of nurses across the country who recognized the challenge of completing training in such a short time frame, but yet, stopped at nothing to help the community at large,\" said Dr. Haya Raz, head of the nursing school at JCT. Dr. Haya Raz (Jerusalem College of Technology) Raz pointed out the need for the urgent addition of manpower since the demand for treating patients with coronavirus is far exceeding what doctors and nurses are currently capable of providing. This is especially true as workers in the health sector are particularly susceptible to the virus. In fact, many health care workers have already been forced into quarantine. \"Doctors and nurses work 12-hour shifts a day as it is. There's only so long they're able to maintain this high level of stress and fatigue before they burn out. This extra help is critical to making sure our healthcare system doesn't collapse,\" she noted. This initiative is one example of the health ministry's strategy to contain the spread of coronavirus. While experts don't know how long this pandemic will last, Ehud Davidson, the general manager of Israel's largest health maintenance organization, Clalit Health Services, has warned that minimizing the outbreak of new infections could take up to three months. share in social medias: Previous Update Next Update More Updates Where does Israel go from here?

TakeAction Corona 'We want to use the TakeAction initiative not only to provide essential relief and resources, but also to bring people together during this extremely difficult time' 10/04/2020 Link to full article in Jerusalem Post As the coronavirus outbreak forces emergency services and nonprofits to keep their distance from the people they normally help, the Jerusalem College of Technology (Machon Lev) has launched the \"TakeAction\" program to provide technological solutions to keep them in contact. (photo credit: Michael Erenberg) Students, alumni and faculty are working with JCT's LevTech Entrepreneurship Center to respond to requests to provide mobile and web-based solutions for emergency medical service and social service organizations. \"We understand that so many entities can use all the help they can get right now, which is why we are recruiting the talents and innovation of JCT for those who need it the most,” said Orlee Guttman, JCT’s Director of Strategic Partnerships and co-Founder of LevTech. “We want to use the TakeAction initiative not only to provide essential relief and resources, but also to bring people together during this extremely difficult time.” The program is working to help ambulance services, a nonprofit that delivers food and medicine to the poor and homebound, services for cancer patients, programs for dementia patients and children with physical and mental disabilities who are now homebound without the therapy they need. Over 300 JCT students, faculty and graduates have joined the TakeAction program. The program is planning to launch Artists TakeAction this week, an online platform for virtual shows in which musicians and other artists will be able to interact live with children who are at home without interactive therapy. Companies such as Wix and Amazon Web Services have partnered with the program to provide voluntary services to help find these tech solutions. Many of JCT's students, including the about 40% who come from the ultra-Orthodox community, were not exposed to cutting-edge technologies before beginning studies at the college. About 20% of all women studying computer science in Israel do so at JCT. LevTech works throughout the year to find solutions to challenges in the medical and social sectors. share in social medias: Previous Update Next Update More Updates Where does Israel go from here?

Haredim in Tech: 50 Shades of Black A quiet but quick revolution where diversity wins the day. 08.10.19 Printed in the Jerusalem Post October 8, 2019 BY ELIANA RUDEE Picture this: a student who has been described as “off the charts bright” graduates from one of Israel’s major academic institutions specializing in hi-tech. After graduation, as a part of a highly selective and intensive software engineering and computer science training, the student reaches the final round of a national cyber security contest and shortly afterward, is hired by Microsoft as a software engineer. Chances are that the student you imagined does not look like Chaya Binet, who became both an award-winning computer scientist and mother at 23 years old. Oh, and she is also haredi (ultra-Orthodox). Indeed, Binet is not the typical hi-tech employee. Neither is she the typical haredi woman, for whom it may have previously been considered unacceptable to seek secular education and work outside of the haredi world – although, perhaps, that is slowly changing. Raised in a haredi “but more open” family, Binet grew up in Romema, Jerusalem, with her parents, one from Israel and the other from New York, and three siblings. Perhaps unlike most haredim , as an adolescent, Binet had access to her family’s shared computer, which she recalls fixing many times as the most technologically oriented member of her family. She was raised to think that “anything is possible.” She took mathematics in high school, and her family has supported her studies and career path. If you ask Binet if she is “typical,” she will tell you that there is “a lot of diversity within haredi communities” and perhaps there is no such thing as a “typical haredi.” Similarly, Shmuel C., a former JCT computer engineering student who now works in management at Rafael Advanced Defense Systems, similarly agreed that even ultra-Orthodox tech students “are not one classification” and that among themselves, they are “so diverse.” He, for example, made aliyah from Madrid and therefore enjoys more acceptance as a working haredi man, which he noted “is not the case for a haredi man who grew up in Israel.” Stuart Hershkowitz, vice president of Jerusalem College of Technology (JCT), sees these kind of examples of diversity within haredi society on a daily basis. In fact, he quips that when it comes to haredim, there are really “50 shades of black.” Within that diverse haredi society today, according to Binet, haredim have begun to understand that “it is hard to afford a family and a house with the husband studying full-time,” and so it has become more acceptable for them to seek secular education for the purposes of working to earn a respectable income. Shmuel, too, noted that many “modern haredi” and hassidic people are choosing to go down the tech path in order to bring home a decent salary for their families. As the head of Rafael’s Cyber Division, Shmuel has hired multiple haredi tech students. He added that the increase of ultra-Orthodox workers not only solves a family-wide problem of poverty, but also a national challenge. With a growing haredi population in which 45% live beneath the poverty line (compared to 11% among other Jewish Israelis), the country will not be able to sustain itself economically if such trends continue. Since less than 50% of haredi men work, women are expected to get decent jobs to support their families, Hershkowitz explained, “but if that doesn’t work, the whole economy has a problem.” At the same time, he posed, there is a shortage of hi-tech workers in Israel, resulting in the outsourcing of many hi-tech jobs – work that haredim could be doing to answer both the micro and macro economic challenges of the ultra-Orthodox and Israel as a whole. As Jon Medved, CEO of OurCrowd told The Jerusalem Post, “Israel has many “tribes” – which is often viewed as a cause of much disagreement and of fragmentation in politics, culture and national life. Rather than seeing this kaleidoscope of people as a negative factor, we should in fact celebrate this diversity as a source of strength, and gain insight and nachat from this multitude of flavors, customs and outlooks.” He continued, adding, “In particular, the technology business sector needs to have active participation from all of Israel’s “tribes” in order to be strong and to recruit sufficient man- and woman-power to grow our wonderful Startup Nation into Scale-Up Nation.” Challenges ahead - According to Hershkowitz, this answer to economic challenges will only be effective if haredim can maintain their religious standards while in school and working. If students came to JCT and became less haredi, he posed, “that would be the end of haredim seeking education, so we do everything [we] can to encourage that.” To make a more “haredi-friendly” environment, JCT offers only practical courses, as opposed to liberal arts classes, and has an active beit midrash open all day, where between 400 and 500 men study Torah daily. Like the large majority of haredim, Binet acknowledged that she wouldn’t have enrolled in a traditional Israeli university with a co-ed environment and without the ability to learn Jewish studies at the same time as her secular studies. JCT was a “great place to learn” where one need not choose between receiving the best education and keeping one’s religiously observant identity, according to Binet. That is not to say that academic life is without great challenges. Studying completely new subjects without prior studies in secular subjects – and oftentimes in a second or new language – is difficult. Because studying is not fully accepted within ultra-Orthodox societies, parents are hesitant to talk to their children about their experiences – and therefore haredi students do not receive the same support at home as non-haredi students. But the most pressing challenge for prospective ultra-Orthodox students, said Hershkowitz, is the cost of education. “The State Comptroller recently came out with a scathing report that there is an 80% dropout rate of all haredi students in higher education, which is a problem,” said Hershkowitz, explaining that the dropout rate, especially during the year-long preparatory course, can be largely attributed to financial challenges. Thus, JCT is currently working to find subsidies for students with financial need so they can continue to study. ‘Under the radar’ understanding within the haredi community - As haredim have come to understand that they need not compromise their identity to solve their economic woes, Hershkowitz told the Post, within haredi communities there is much more understanding today for individuals who choose to study and work than even five years ago, with fewer being ostracized from the community for taking such a path. Shmuel maintained that while haredi women are “well accepted, given that they are in a suitable environment,” there is a clear preference for men to dedicate themselves to the study of the Torah and “therefore you will not hear the same acceptance in the street [for haredi men who study at a technological college].” A man who studies secular subjects, he said, might be considered a “modern haredi” and “not part of the mainstream haredi community.” However, according to Binet, with more educational opportunities in which women and men can study in single-gender environments, “this is something that even [haredi] rabbis are supportive of,” she told the Post. Hershkowitz added a disclaimer that ultra-Orthodox rabbis, although offering “green lights” on a one-on-one basis to prospective students, are doing so under the radar, careful not to endorse this path publicly. The changes that take place in haredi society therefore represent a “bottom-up grassroots evolution” that can be observed through the steady increase of ultra-Orthodox elementary schools teaching Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics (STEM), girls’ schools with vocational training and men’s schools offering high school matriculation certificates when those possibilities did not previously exist. “This is still certainly not mainstream, but people are more and more aware of it happening,” said Hershkowitz. Compared to other social revolutions, he continued, “this revolution is moving relatively quickly despite the fact that the haredi leadership has not embraced it.” Accommodating ultra-Orthodox life during studies and work - Once in the workforce, companies accommodate haredim by bringing in food of varying kashrut standards for varying needs, including when traveling abroad. Many companies will seat ultra-Orthodox employees next to individuals of the same gender if requested. At Rafael, Shmuel told the Post, haredi women are even able to work from other offices in the North. “Rafael is a company that has a clear mission to [defend] the country and is not just a proper and valid business value,” he said. In Binet’s group at Microsoft, she is not the only ultra-Orthodox woman and reports feeling “very supported” as a religious woman in tech, both by Microsoft and by others in her community who have positive notions of working “at big tech companies like Microsoft, Facebook and Google.” Haredim bring work ethic and open mindedness - Such inclusion of haredim in the tech space, posed Hershkowitz, has resulted in a higher work ethic and dedication in Israeli companies that employ ultra-Orthodox individuals. “Haredim are very diligent and hard-working,” he said, maintaining that they don’t “jump around jobs” as often as the general tech population, “gossip less at the water cooler” and take their responsibilities particularly seriously. Inclusion in the workplace, Binet said, brings diverse thinking and open mindedness to tech companies, with non-haredi individuals who “only see really bad stuff in the news about haredim.” Normalization in the workspace, she said, combats the idea that ultra-Orthodox Jews have any singular characteristics, beliefs and experiences. “They see that we are okay and are just like them,” she posed. Shmuel, too, noted that the presence of haredim “breaks a lot of bad impressions [non-haredim] have [of] the haredi world.” Hershkowitz recalled seeing an ultra-Orthodox woman who worked at Texas Instruments speaking to a secular man for the first time, which he said “takes away stigmas and misconceptions on both sides.” “We are all human beings and live in the State of Israel,” he continued. “We all have families and we want to do the best for them. The fact that they are working together, that they appreciate and respect each other, has great potential for the social fiber of Israel.” A continuing trend? share in social medias: Previous Update Next Update More Updates Where does Israel go from here?

JCT - A massive Engine in Integrating Haredim into Academia Home Page News and Updates ... Yaffa Zilbershatz 50th Anniversary to JCT. \"We fully believe in combining high-level technological studies alongside the preservation of Torah life without compromise.\" september 2019 The Lev Academic Center in Jerusalem celebrated tonight (Thursday) its 50 th anniversary.  Attending the event were Minister of transportation, Bezalel Smotrich, Mayor of Jerusalem, Moshe Leon and Deputy Mayor, Fleur Hassan, who holds the portfolio of external affairs in the city . Also participating were Prof. Yaffa Zilberschatz, Chairman of the Planning and budgeting Committee of the Council of Higher Education, Professor Chaim Sukenik, President of JCT, Yossi Zeira, JCT CEO, Kenneth Hochberg, JCT rector and Kurt Rothschild, co-founder of JCT . Professor Zilberschatz said in her speech that the \"Lev Academic Center plays a central role in the important national mission of integrating Ethiopian population into the Israeli Academy. In addition, JCT is worthy of all praise and mention for its enlistment in making higher education accessible to the Haredi population, spearheading the cracking of this complex challenge of integrating Haredim into academia. “The haredim insist on gender separated campuses as a condition of their entry into the academic system while large parts of the academic system oppose this step. As a result, it is only natural for Lev Academic Center, an institution which from its inception was established with the concept of separate gender campuses, to have the opportunity be a huge engine in the integration of the Haredim into the higher education system .\" Zilberschatz also emphasized that \"if you wish to fulfill the idea of [combining] Torah and Science, then the Lev Academic Center is the best place to go \". The mayor of Jerusalem, Moshe Leon, shared \"in two weeks, we will mark the 15 th anniversary of the passing of Israel Prize winner Professor Ze'ev Lev, founder of the Lev Academic Center. Prof. Lev was a yeshiva student with rabbinic lineage and a scientist. He hoped that the combination of these two strong elements -- Torah and science - - in founding the Lev Academic Center, would produce a massive force multiplier . Professor Lev was a man of actions and vision, and I doubt that in his wildest dreams he envisioned that JCT would develop so rapidly and affect in such an immeasurable way the integration of Haredim into the Israeli society . The thousands of Haredim - who have completed their secondary schooling and academic degree at JCT, who now succeed in integrating in their lives Torah, science, livelihood and ‘Derech Eretz’ - will attest to that,\" Leon said . The Rabbinic Head of Lev Academic Center, Rabbi Yosef Zvi Rimon, noted that \"in the Lev Academic Center we get to integrate Torah and science, and I'm excited to see a lively Beit Midrash here. Every class is full of questions and discussions, and the students here live Torah life in its fullest, along with the highest level of academia. Today I know that the more you learn and deepen in the Beit Midrash, the more successful you are in the academia. There's an amazing thing going on here in the institution, when the Torah creates energy and power to do things beyond imagination .\" Prof. Chaim Sukenik, JCT President, said that \"Professor Lev and Kurt Rothschild faced a huge task convincing the regulators to support the establishment of another institution of higher education in Jerusalem based on a combination of the world of Torah and science. Professor Lev's message was that all challenges could be met and a proof for that are our graduates who fill senior sensitive positions in the defense industry and high-tech fields . Nowadays, there are, unfortunately many parties of interests that are trying to harm an institution that combines Torah learning without compromising values, but we believe entirely ן n our cause, and in the need to preserve technological education at the highest level alongside maintaining uncompromising Torah life,\" Sukenik said . share in social medias: Previous Update Next Update More Updates Where does Israel go from here?

From Vision to Reality: JCT Dinner Celebrates 50 Years of Achievement Home Page News and Updates ... JCT Anniversary Dinner Celebrates 50 Years of Achievement From Haredim to Ethiopians to everyone in between, JCT has proven since 1969 that Israel can be the land of opportunity for students from any background. 22.09.19 Full article in NJ Jewish Link The Jerusalem College of Technology (JCT), a leader in providing high-level science and technology education to religious students in Israel and beyond, celebrated its 50th anniversary at a festive ceremony last week. The event, which took place at the college’s Schloss Plaza in Jerusalem, featured remarks from Jerusalem Mayor Moshe Lion and Prof. Yaffa Zilbershats, Chair of the Planning and Budgeting Committee of the Israeli Council of Higher Education. The two leaders extolled JCT’s parallel legacies of inclusion and academic excellence, in which the institution has empowered its students to obtain a high-quality education and subsequently employment in their fields of choice regardless of their gender, ethnicity or level of religious observance. \"In two weeks, we will mark 15 years since the passing of Israel Prize Winner, Prof. Ze'ev Lev, who established the Jerusalem College of Technology. Part of a long scion of Rabbis, a Yeshiva student and a scientist, Prof. Lev decided to build his life upon two solid foundations - Torah and science,\" Mayor Lion said. \"By combining these two principles, he saw an exponential strength and established here JCT, whose 50th anniversary we are celebrating today. Prof. Lev was a man of actions and vision, but I doubt that even he would he have saw coming the rapid development and influence of this powerful institution and its impact on the integration of Haredim into Israeli society.\" Attendees listened to singer Aaron Razel perform while standing adjacent to where the school’s new Tal Campus for Women will be built. The 30,000-square-foot Tal building will become the permanent home to JCT’s enriching programs for women, which include nursing, computer science, electro-optics, industrial engineering, accounting and management, and a pre-academic mechina (preparatory) program for Haredi and Ethiopian students. “Our founder Prof. Lev would be proud of what we’ve accomplished over the past half century, which squarely aligns with his original founding vision for the college,” said Stuart Hershkowitz, Vice President of JCT. “Sadly, many demographic sectors in Israel are pushed to the margins of society and lag behind in the workforce. At JCT, we provide these underserved communities with the tools they need to ensure they will have a seat at the table, not only for themselves, but for generations to come.” JCT’s empowerment of underserved Israeli populations includes the following accomplishments: The college’s Haredi graduates attain an 89 percent employment rate, far exceeding the roughly 50 percent employment rate for Haredi men in Israel as a whole. 53 percent of JCT’s computer science students are women, who account for 20 percent of female computer science students in all of Israel, bucking the stereotype about women’s relative lack of interest in science and technology careers; these 2,000 female students enjoy a 90 percent employment rate upon graduation. Over 180 Ethiopian students have graduated from the Reuven Surkis Program for Students from the Ethiopian Community; 97 percent of these Ethiopian students have gained employment and more than 50 percent have gone on to pursue graduate studies. Further, JCT has passionately followed Prof. Lev’s vision of addressing acute needs in the Israeli workforce. From JCT’s Electro-Optics Engineering Department, which is integral to the country’s defense sector and start-up scene, to its nursing program, the institution fills voids across various sectors in Israel’s economy that have well-documented needs for additional talent. share in social medias: Previous Update Next Update More Updates Where does Israel go from here?

JCT launches new Torah and Technology Research Center Home Page News and Updates ... JCT launches new Torah and Technology Research Center New Center aims to tackle tough questions at the intersection of innovation and religion. 03.10.19 Full article in the Atlanta Jewish Times The Jerusalem College of Technology announced the launch of the first-of-its-kind Torah and Technology Research Center Sept. 21. It will provide the specialized expertise necessary to respond to the complex ethical and halachic (Jewish legal) issues of our times.  Operating under the direction of internationally respected Rabbi Yosef Tzvi Rimon, head of JCT’s yeshiva and Jewish studies programs, the center pioneers a unusual collaboration between Halachic experts and renowned faculty members from the college’s computer science, engineering and health sciences departments. Through this partnership, the center tries to address the influx of emerging questions pertaining to both Torah and technology, such as: Is it permissible to ride in an autopilot vehicle on Shabbat? Can “meat” grown using cells taken from a pig be kosher, or even pareve Can you send Alexa voice commands on Shabbat? Rabbi Michael Broyde, Emory Law School professor and founding rabbi of the former Young Israel synagogue, spoke to the AJT about the benefits of programs like that of JCT.  “Every community that aspires to live in the modern world need to study modernity,” he said. “Technological advances, like all change, needs to be examined to see how it ought to be incorporated into Jewish law.” Rabbi Rimon noted that despite constant technological advances, there is a lack of a centralized body to tackle halachic challenges that arise.  “Today, not only are Halachic authorities struggling to keep up with the flood of questions regarding issues that never before existed, but they also lack the technological expertise necessary to understand the full scope of the issues,” Rimon said. “The Torah and Technology Research Center strives to solve this dilemma by facilitating an unprecedented meeting of the minds across Halacha and science.” Among his numerous scholarly writings, Rabbi Rimon most recently published a two-volume set of books entitled “Shabbat” as a first step towards a comprehensive in-depth analysis of the prohibitions of Shabbat. He is also the founder and chairman of Sulamot (formerly the Halacha Education Center), an organization that develops cutting-edge educational technologies and innovative curricula for Jewish studies. Sulamot will be partnering with JCT in the Torah and Technology Research Center.  JCT incorporates Jewish tradition while also working on 21st century problems.  “Rabbi Rimon is both an excellent Torah scholar and a stellar administrator and one certainly hopes that this program will reach and exceed its potential,” Broyde said. Support for the center is made possible by the Walder Foundation, a family foundation based in the Chicago area. In addition to serving as a centralized authority for the international Jewish community, the nascent research center will facilitate the development of innovative technologies specifically adapted to meet halachic requirements for Shabbat, among other areas, and will disseminate scholarly material. “I hope that this program will be an excellent resource,” Broyde said. “Placing it at a university that is technologically focused increases the sense that it will understand the technology it is considering, a needed precondition for reaching the right answers.”  Proper understanding of technology is key to finding correct answers. The center will also host international conferences that will bring leading experts from around the world to JCT to discuss recent innovations and developments on both the Halachic and technological fronts. An important goal of the center is to engage the broader public in serious discussions of these issues to promote greater appreciation of their importance and to educate the public on even the most complex topics, JCT reported. “For five decades, JCT has been tremendously proud of our excellence in both Jewish studies and technology-related fields. This has expressed itself in providing high-level training to a student body which spans the religious community from Haredi to Dati Leumi. This unparalleled track record places our college in a unique position to be a trailblazer at the intersection of Torah and technology through the new center,” said professor Chaim Sukenik, president of JCT. share in social medias: Previous Update Next Update More Updates Where does Israel go from here?

JCT opens 2019 school year on campus JCT kicked off the academic year on September 1st with festive events at the college’s various campuses. 06.09.19 JCT kicked off the academic year on September 1 st with festive events at the college’s various campuses.  Lev Campus held a special gathering in the Beit Midrash.  Following the main ceremony, students continued to learn in chevrutot (pairs and small groups) to prepare for the auspicious month of Elul, together with their rabbis and teachers.  The Tvuna program for Haredim- a recognized leader of academic programs for ultra-Orthodox women- opened its academic year with a significant increase in the number of students and a welcome ceremony with Rabbinate Miriam Weinberg. Approximately 500 new students began their studies in engineering, business management and health science faculties in various programs at Tal’s women campus.  Among the new female students, this year students arrived from a considerable number of other countries including, France, Brazil, Morocco, Canada, the United States, Russia, Switzerland, Chile and more. Student Director Eli Shelman said, “JCT is a Torani academic institution, in fact the only one in the country, so the opening of the school year takes place on the first day of Elul.  It turns out that this year the first of Elul is also September 1 st , the same day all schools across the country are opening.  JCT opened all three faculties, health engineering and management.  To my delight, there is a large growth in the number of students this year and it’s evident in all departments.  Of the 4,500 students enrolled, 1,500 began their studies this September.  After the high holidays, a new master's degree program will open in information mining, a field in high demand in the high-tech industry. Student Union Chair, Sizer Yitzhak Caesar congratulated the students and explained, \"We at the Student Union walk around the campus and meet all the new students and explain the union’s role and ongoing activities, which offers a great deal of services during their degree, as well as concern for their students’ rights. We work hard to create a good atmosphere on campus and to organize as many events and activities as possible.  We just recently organized a show with Yishai Ribo and are preparing to kick off a year full of activities on campus.  On this occasion, I would like to wish all the students a year of great success. \" share in social medias: Previous Update Next Update More Updates Where does Israel go from here?

Tackling the intersections of Torah and technology JCT's new Torah and Technology Research Center will provide the diverse, specialized expertise needed to respond to the complex ethical and Halachic issues of our times. 28/08/19 Tackling the intersection of Torah and technology By Stuart Hershkowitz Alexa, can you turn off those lights in the kitchen? The rapid pace of technological development and innovation has many Shabbat-observant Jews asking how can Alexa fit into their Shabbat observance. In fact, this is just one of the numerous contemporary questions which find themselves at the intersection of Torah and modern technology. Is it permissible to ride in an autonomous vehicle on Shabbat? Can “meat” grown from the cells of a pig be kosher, or even parve? The possibilities — and their associated consequences — are seemingly endless. These new-age grey areas within Halacha (Jewish law) stem from the rapid ongoing development of the worlds of Torah and technology. Today’s Halachic and rabbinic authorities not only struggle to keep up with the flood of questions regarding issues that never previously existed, but, in many cases, they also lack the technological expertise necessary to understand the full scope of those issues. Until now, there has been no centralized, scholarly body equipped to organically tackle the multitude of the Halachic implications and questions that arise as a result of modern technology. But the Jerusalem College of Technology (JCT) has now launched that very entity — the first-of-its-kind Torah and Technology Research Center, which will provide the diverse, specialized, expertise which is needed to respond to the complex ethical and Halachic issues of our times. The expertise will be culled from a unique combination of rabbinic scholars and engineering professors functioning within the kind of mutually supportive environment needed for such a joint effort to succeed. Previously unimagined collaborations between Halachic experts and renowned faculty members from JCT’s computer science, engineering, and health sciences departments, will provide a groundbreaking centralized authority for the international Jewish community on the interplay between Torah and modern technology. The center will also work with other organizations (both companies and not-for-profits) to facilitate the development of innovative technologies specifically adapted to meet Halachic requirements for Shabbat, among other areas; publish both advanced scholarly treatises and readily accessible academic material for the public; and host international symposia that will bring leading experts from around the world to JCT to discuss the most recent innovations and developments on both the Halachic and technological fronts. An innovative web-based forum will allow the Center to also encourage public engagement in the discussion of these topics with an eye towards identifying new approaches and new ideas and with the hope that we can enhance communal understanding, connection, and broad buy-in with some of the more complex topics and futuristic innovations. The Torah and Technology Research Center will operate under the direction of internationally respected posek (Halachic decisor) Rabbi Yosef Tzvi Rimon, head of JCT’s yeshiva and Jewish studies programs. Rabbi Rimon’s unique qualifications to lead the center are reflected in his Halachic writings, which are known for taking readers from the Torah sources to the practical application of Halacha in our modern world within the framework of a user-friendly, pedagogical methodology. This includes his most recently published work, “Shabbat,” a two-volume set of books (the prelude to a planned 7 volume series) which features a comprehensive analysis of the prohibitions of Shabbat. At the same time, on an institution-wide level, JCT is in a unique position to support this groundbreaking center due to its abundance of religiously and technologically sophisticated faculty and students, spanning the range of the orthodox Jewish World from Haredi to Dati Leumi. Unpacking the Torah-technology balance in Halachic decision-making is a natural extension of JCT’s institutional ethos of encouraging students to integrate Torah studies into their day to day academic life. Further, the center cuts to the core of the college’s founding vision. The original blueprint of JCT’s founder and first president, Prof. Ze’ev Lev, was to establish a higher education institution that would educate bnei torah (seriously religious torah students) with a special sensitivity to the State of Israel’s greatest needs. For instance, when JCT’s Electro-optics Engineering Department was launched in 1969, it was the first of its kind in Israel and among the first in the world.. Prof. Lev saw the need and JCT’s students delivered, using their unique training in an emerging field to pioneer the technologies which continue to ensure the safety of countless Israeli citizens. Today, the electro-optics expertise emanating from JCT’s campus holds the key to the high-speed communication and imaging capabilities that feed Israel’s defense sector and its booming tech start-up scene. Extending beyond engineering, the same vision is embodied in other programs at the college. Addressing the Jewish state’s severe shortage of nurses — as the country stands near the bottom of the OECD in nurse-to-patient ratio — JCT’s Nursing Department has been ranked first among its over 20 peer institutions nationwide by the Israeli Ministry of Health. Now, through the nascent Torah and Technology Research Center, JCT is once again filling a pressing need — not just for Israel, but for all of the Jewish people, as they address contemporary questions and concerns at the interface of technology and Halacha. share in social medias: Previous Update Next Update More Updates Where does Israel go from here?

This year JCT also certified 19 male graduates from the nursing department.  The first of its kind in Israel, the new and unique program opened in 2015 and is revolutionizing career possibilities available to religious men. 29/07/19 This year 215 new JCT students received graduation certificates and are now ready to embark on positions in management, health and nursing professions. This year JCT also certified 19 male graduates from the nursing department. The first of its kind in Israel, the new and unique program opened in 2015 and is revolutionizing career possibilities available to religious men. The ceremony’s guest of honor was Professor Yonatan Halevi, co-director of Shaare Zedek Medical Center, who remarked: \"The connection between JCT and Shaare Zedek is that both are proudly known as religious institutions. Ever prior to its construction, the hospital’s founding constitution was dedicated to ensuring that the institution’s management would forever operate according to Jewish law. We expect doctors, nurses and anyone who comes in contact with patients to make decisions from a place of compassion, empathy, and sensitivity to others. As Maimonides wrote: \"He who sees the patient must be happy\". He understood then what we are beginning to understand today: the body and the soul are completely interconnected; giving joy and hope to a patient offers immediate relief and directly impacts their chances of healing. A robot may be able to help provide more accurate treatments, but it can never replace the value of human empathy that is exchanged between a doctor and a patient”. share in social medias: Previous Update Next Update More Updates Where does Israel go from here?

Questions? 2nd Annual Women's Hackathon @ Tal Home Page News and Updates ... 2nd Annual Women's Hackathon @ Tal Solution for wearable device to better monitor infants' oxygen levels wins Jerusalem College of Technology’s 2nd Annual Women’s Hackathon. 17.06.19 Other challenges at the event were provided by IBM, Rafael Defense Systems, Magen David Adom, and Cybersafe. See full article in the Jerusalem Post Or in Arutz 7 A group of students at the Jerusalem College of Technology (JCT) won a prize for designing a wireless oxygen saturation monitor for infants as part of the second annual women’s hackathon at the college’s Machon Tal campus last week. The challenge, presented by Intel and Alyn Children’s Hospital, was to create a more comfortable way to monitor oxygen levels in infants’ bloodstream, as opposed to the commonly used device which has proven uncomfortable for children, explained Hadass Wittow, a third-year computer science student at JCT who was part of the winning team. Typically, the device is clipped to a finger and attached with wires, but the newly developed product will allow for wireless monitoring attached to an infant’s toe and part of a special sock which will be much more comfortable, she said. The device was designed as a part of the college’s annual “Hack@Tal,” a 44-hour hackathon in which more than 100 women participated, ranging from Modern Orthodox to ultra-Orthodox. “It was really amazing to be able to take this thing from zero, from just a challenge presented, and develop this tremendous product that can create real change and help a lot of people,” said Wittow, adding that she and her team only slept for four out of the 44 hours. The second-place prize at the competition was awarded to a team of women who used machine learning to automatically detect the images of patients and blur them, which enables organizations and hospitals to protect the privacy of their patients. “It’s very challenging, I’m very tired, but it’s a lot of fun and I feel like I’m really accomplishing something,” said Esti David, a third-year computer science student and mother of three. David, 25, explained that she worked as a special education teacher prior to beginning her studies at JCT’s Machon Tal. “I didn’t feel like that job was challenging me, so I’m very happy I started learning here,” she explained. “The [college] really respects and values mothers. There’s a special [nursery] at the hackathon since we are here all night, and all year there is so much support.” Orlee Guttman, director of strategic partnerships at JCT and organizer of the event, said the goal of the college’s women’s program is to empower Orthodox women by inviting them to participate in challenges such as the hackathon. “Many of these [ultra-Orthodox] women have never been exposed to this sort of technology – some don’t even have Internet at home – and now they are working with and creating hi-tech trailblazing technology: it’s truly incredible,” she said. At the event, many mothers were tasked with the additional challenge of trying to code and program with one hand, while holding a baby in the other. For this reason, JCT provided daycare services throughout the hackathon, said Guttman. “These women are setting the precedent that you can be a trailblazer while maintaining your values; being a haredi mother and working in hi-tech are not mutually exclusive.” “We will continue to work hard so that this type of engineering and innovation will continue to come from these women and these communities,” she added.

Celebrating Yom Yerushalayim along with JCT's 50th Anniversary On June 2nd, Israelis and Jews worldwide celebrated Yom Yerushalayim (Jerusalem Day), marking 52 years since the city’s reunification during the Six Day War. 02.06.2019 Haredi academics: A blueprint for Jerusalem’s future June 2, 2019 By Stuart Hershkowitz Click for full post in Times of Israel What’s in an anniversary? As nations and institutions mark their milestones year after year, the celebrations can often feel formulaic. Does being one year older make a real difference? Does it matter when a particular year’s anniversary is a big round number, like 50? That’s the question I’ve been asking myself as the college where I serve in the administration, the Jerusalem College of Technology (JCT) , prepares to celebrate its 50th anniversary later this year. As I reflect on the significance of our milestone, what comes to mind is a different and higher-profile milestone that occurred two years ago: the 50th anniversary of a reunified Jerusalem. From June 1-2, Israelis and Jews worldwide will observe Yom Yerushalayim (Jerusalem Day), marking 52 years since the city’s reunification during the Six Day War. Make no mistake: the reunification was a defining moment in Jewish history. But this moment also serves as an important reminder that we — both JCT and Israel as a whole — still have plenty of work to do when it comes to life in the city of Jerusalem, especially on the issue of socioeconomic equality. Poverty is a nationwide problem for Israel. According to a study released last December by the National Insurance Institute, more than 21 percent of Israelis live below the poverty line , giving Israel the highest poverty rate among the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) countries. Jerusalem, meanwhile, has long been the poorest major city in Israel — largely because it has the highest concentration of Arab and Haredi residents among those cities. The poverty rates for Israel’s Arab and Haredi families in 2017 were 47% and 43%, respectively, the National Insurance Institute study found. Jews around the world are driven to undertake social action and community service projects through the principle of tikkun olam (repairing the world). Yet the center of the Jewish world, Jerusalem, is arguably also the most socioeconomically vulnerable city in the Jewish world. This is a critical issue for the future of Israel and the Jewish people, and it deserves our immediate attention — especially on Jerusalem Day. At JCT, our concerns extend beyond the walls of our own institution. We care about our city and we take concrete actions to spur socioeconomic progress in the community that surrounds us. Unfolding on a parallel track with what will soon be 52 years of a reunified Jerusalem, JCT’s 50-year-long history is a remarkable story of creating unprecedented prosperity for underserved populations in Israeli society such as Ethiopians and Haredim. For decades, we’ve witnessed unacceptable levels of poverty in Jerusalem. We’ve responded by pioneering an academic solution to the Haredi employment dilemma. JCT’s Haredi graduates have an 89% employment rate, including 77% in their field of choice — far exceeding the roughly 50% employment rate for Haredi men across Israel. We achieve this progress by providing the necessary academic support and resources to succeed in STEM subjects (science, technology, engineering, and mathematics) disciplines, enabling our students to attain employment in the professions within Israel’s job market with the greatest current demand for skilled labor. With experts warning of a future shortage of administrative jobs in Israel, the problem of Haredi unemployment will likely worsen in the coming years without a greater nationwide commitment to educating Haredim in STEM subjects. According to the Taub Center, the average monthly wage for Haredi men working full-time and possessing a higher education degree is 80% higher than full-time Haredi male workers who haven’t graduated from college, while the average monthly wage is 71% higher for Haredi women with a college degree. The ticket to prosperity for the Haredi community, therefore, is a high-quality education in a discipline which will provide a clear path to employment. When it comes to a brighter and more equitable socioeconomic future in Jerusalem, JCT’s mission extends far beyond the Haredi community. Shattering the stereotype of women’s relative lack of interest in science and technology, 53% of our computer science students are women — 18% higher than any other Israeli college or university. And our Reuven Surkis Program for Students from the Ethiopian Community empowers young Ethiopian-Israelis to improve their lives by enabling them to earn an academic degree and pursue careers in high-tech, business, and the Israel Defense Forces, producing graduates with a 95% employment rate. On this Jerusalem Day, let’s do more than celebrate the anniversary of the city’s reunification. Let’s commit to a more prosperous future for Jerusalem. That means taking steps to alleviate poverty in Israel’s eternal capital, chief among them supporting high-quality academics for Haredim in order to set them up for success in the workforce. share in social medias: Previous Update Next Update More Updates Where does Israel go from here?

Haredi academics thrive at JCT The Jewish state’s future economy and society can’t possibly prosper if over a quarter of the country’s citizens are left behind. May 28, 2019 May 28, 2019 10:55 Click for full JPost article Haredi students at the Jerusalem College of Technology. (photo credit: JERUSALEM COLLEGE OF TECHNOLOGY) The Central Bureau of Statistics (CBS) projects that Israel’s haredi community will grow from its current 11% share of the total population to 27% during the next 40 years. It is simply too important to fail. The Jewish state’s future economy and society can’t possibly prosper if over a quarter of the country’s citizens are left behind. Yet “failing” is what’s taking place, according to a new report issued by the state comptroller and the subsequent media coverage about the report. In an effort to raise haredi employment levels (which have hovered around 50% among men and 70% among women) so that they are closer to those of the non-haredi population (90% for men and 80% for women), the Israeli government invested NIS 550 million ($153m.) from 2011-2018 and earmarked another NIS 1.1 billion ($306m.) through 2022 for higher education programs for Haredim. Indeed, from 2011 to the 2016-17 academic year, enrollment in Israel’s gender-segregated colleges geared towards the haredi community rose from 6,000 to 11,465 students. But that didn’t meet the government’s goal of 14,500, and the enrollment decreased by 500 students in 2017-18. The State Comptroller’s report found that despite the government’s goal of greater academic participation and ultimately greater employment among Haredi men, a striking gender imbalance remains: 78% of graduates of haredi academic programs are women. Meanwhile, 75% of men and more than half of women dropped out of these programs before earning their degrees. Perhaps most concerning – as State Comptroller Joseph Shapira articulated – is the state’s misallocation of resources to the teaching profession, where a surplus of qualified labor exists in the Israeli job market. This is especially true in the haredi community, where 86% of trained educators eventually pursue jobs in other professions. At the haredi academic institutions examined in the comptroller’s report, nearly half of the enrolled students study education (29%) or social sciences (19%). Meanwhile, a total of only 18% study engineering and architecture (9%) as well as math, statistics, and computer science (9%). Nonetheless, Israel’s Council for Higher Education has continued to invest in teaching programs. “If so, the state is investing much of its resources to encourage women to learn a subject in which the supply far exceeds the demand,” Shapira wrote in the report. But Israel shouldn’t accept this “failure” as inevitable. For years, the Jerusalem College of Technology (JCT) has maintained that providing high-quality STEM (science, technology, engineering, and mathematics) education is the key to greater employment in the haredi community. For JCT’s more than 2,000 haredi students (within a total student body of 4,500), this formula works – 89% of our haredi graduates attain employment, including 77% in their field of choice. How is this possible? It’s really no secret: STEM majors pursue careers with shortages of professionals in the Israeli economy, rather than exacerbating the surpluses in fields like teaching. Accordingly, the state has a clear way forward to a much brighter future in haredi academics and employment: dramatically increasing its investment in STEM education, not only at institutions specifically geared towards haredim, but at all of Israel’s colleges and universities. After all, JCT is not a “haredi college.” We’re the second-largest academic institution in Jerusalem. Haredim make up about 45% of our students, as we also serve the National Religious community. What we do offer haredi students is a religiously sensitive campus environment where they can thrive academically, maintain a significant time commitment for Jewish studies and chart a practical course to a fulfilling and financially viable future career. Concerns about the State Comptroller’s report are surely justified – Israelis should expect a tangible return on their investment when the government dedicates such substantial sums for haredi academics. Yet the current problem can be overcome. The state can take a major step towards solving it by allocating more funds for training professionals in fields which aren’t oversaturated. That means greater investment in STEM education in haredi-friendly institutions offering high quality training. Israel can’t give up on haredi academics and employment. It is too important to fail.

Life-saving solution for MDA ambulances wins hackathon prize The 3rd annual Great Minds Hackathon, also saw challenges presented by Intel, IBM, and Rafael Advanced Defense Systems. 20/05/19 Click link for full article: http://www.israelnationalnews.com/News/News.aspx/263406 Arutz Sheva Staff, 20/05/19 Over 80 male Jerusalem College of Technology students from Israel and 23 other countries gathered at the college’s Machon Lev campus and worked around the clock from Wednesday evening through Friday morning last week as part of the its 3rd annual Great Minds hackathon. The winning team, consisting of Brazilians Daniel Vofchuk, David Zimberknopf and Daniel Grunberger, won a 3,000 shekel ($839) prize for their life-saving solution to a challenge presented by Magen David Adom (MDA), designed to eliminate human error when checking crucial inventory on ambulances before they are sent out. Having to use a paper checklist of well over 100 items, everyday MDA personnel must check inside the ambulance manually, allowing important devices and medications to get left behind when the ambulances dispatch. Around the world, instances arise when ambulances arrive at places without critical lifesaving equipment like oxygen, a defibrillator batteries, or even needles. The winning solution developed an app where sensors installed in the ambulance will be able to identify necessary items and communicate with a tablet on board to notify if something is missing. “In addition to a student at JCT, I am also an EMT volunteer for Magen David Adom, so this challenge really spoke to me personally and I knew the problem first-hand,” said Vofchuk. “At this hackathon, I was able to put my high-level studies of engineering at JCT into practice, together with my knowledge as an EMT, to hopefully save lives and help more people.” “We are so excited to work with these students. They have great questions and are very creative – both the international students and the Israeli students,” said Matanya Frankel, one of the mentors from Magen David Adom who worked with the students throughout the hackathon. Prizes for second and third place at the hackathon were given to solutions in machine learning to identify online anti-Semitism and take action, while other challenges included a solution involving video analytics and machine learning to identify road accidents in real-time and alert emergency services, an at-home training device for MDA medics, and a solution for soldiers with PTSD to provide improved therapy. “At JCT, we started doing hackathons on campus in order to enable our students to take what they learn in their engineering, business, and nursing ourses and then create,” said Orlee Gutman, Director of Strategic Partnerships at JCT. “What we find each year is that what appeals to our students are challenges that save lives and are critical to the well-being of the community, and we couldn’t be prouder of them. In addition to the means, we also provide them a platform to take the prototypes they create and develop them into products ready for market, so they can see their ideas truly make an impact.” share in social medias: Previous Update Next Update More Updates Where does Israel go from here?

JCT's 26th Annual Torah and Science Conference How do you fly a spaceship into the Moon without desecrating Shabbat? How will halacha be affected by the entrance of robots into our lives? Answers to these questions and many others were discussed at this year’s Annual Torah and Science Conference held at JCT in Jerusalem. 14. 04. 19 Adapted from article published in Hebrew by Chezki Baruch on April 14, 2019 https://www.inn.co.il/News/News.aspx/399289 How do you fly a spaceship to the moon without desecrating Shabbat? How will halacha be affected by the entrance of robots into our lives? Answers to these questions and many others were discussed at this year’s Annual Torah and Science Conference held at JCT in Jerusalem. The 26th Torah and Science Conference was held at JCT- Lev Academic Center in Jerusalem. The annual conference, which was held this year in cooperation with Bar-Ilan University, brings together senior researchers and rabbis who work to develop the ongoing dialogue between Torah and science and to discuss the most pressing issues and technological innovations that are relevant to rabbis, researchers and tech users. This year, the conference dealt with topics such as human vs. artificial intelligence and understanding all of the underlying halachic implications; the connection between medicine and biology; ethical dilemmas of physicians; and whether archeology is capable of contradicting ancient writings when no evidence has been uncovered in the excavation areas. The conference was organized by Prof. Noah Dana Picard and the Lev Prize (named after Prof. Ze'ev Lev, founder of the Lev Academic Center) was awarded to Prof. Avraham Steinberg, who is active in the field of medical ethics and has headed public committees on the subject of transplants and dying patients.  Among other accomplishments, he has published 42 books and 292 professional articles.  Prof. Haim Sukenik, President of the Academic Center of Israel was very honored to give Rabbi Avraham Steinberg the prize. One of the most interesting parts of the conference was discussing the landing of the Israeli spacecraft \"Beresheit\" on the moon.  After a Skype conversation with Ariel Gomez, a graduate of the Lev Academic Center and one of the engineers flying the spacecraft to the moon, some of the questions that arose included: Who is the \"rabbi of the spacecraft\"?  Who is responsible for all of the halachic aspects of observing Shabbat during the spacecraft's two-month voyage to the moon.  \"When night falls on the moon and the international media proclaims that the State of Israel has landed a spaceship on the moon- it will be a national accomplishment and a tremendous Kiddush Hashem.  It reinforces Israel’s national resilience and strength.  Although the topic wasn’t connected to saving lives, we needed to find the right halachic solutions to relate to the issue. Another important issue was addressed by Rabbi Yosef Yitzchok Lifshitz, who called on dayanim (rabbinical judges) and rabbis to consult with psychologists and psychiatrists in cases of agunot ( men who refuse to give their wives a get) and mesoravot get (women who refuse to receive a get) . \"I would like them to check the person who refuses to give a get for many years and to consider that he may be suffering from a mental disorder,\" he said. It is not always possible but many times it is certainly possible. The halachic definition and the way we value the person is important.  The woman may be asked whether she would marry her husband if she knew before the wedding that he was suffering from a mental disorder.  Since she would have refused to do so, the marriage could be annulled on the basis of the definition of \"blind mistake\" and save the life of that woman.  \"This is not halachic innovation,\" explained Rabbi Dr. Lifschitz, \"but a call to rabbis to turn to psychologists and psychiatrists. They are usually not invited to court and rabbis do not consult with them enough outside the court.  Rabbis and judges should do it much more”. Dr. Yitzhak Meitlis shattered the idea that archeological truths could be relied upon and explained that ancient inscriptions were often based on events that occurred, but archeology has not found corroboration on the ground.  But it’s clear that these events occurred.  Similarly the Torah should be a legitimate source, but many of its claims have been proved by other sources. \"There are Assyrian scriptures and other ancient writings that no one can dispute their historical validity, even though they do not have findings on the ground,\" he says. “Archeology changes and history changes over the years and we are reaching new conclusions all the time.  What I learned as a student is not necessarily still true today”. Prof. Noah Dana-Picard concluded: \"I am not surprised by the obvious connection between Torah and science. We deal with subjects that are relevant both to those who adhere to Halacha as well as to scientists. The connection between the spheres is always increasing.  The more we investigate, the more we find that again and again it proves that there is no contradiction between Torah and science and even more so, quite the opposite is true.  It is precisely through science we become even better acquainted with God’s world and creation”. share in social medias: Previous Update Next Update More Updates Where does Israel go from here?

Haredi women are the biggest feminists of all Interview with Tal graduate Elisheva Epstein, Head of the Development Team at CrediFI 20.12.2018 I am a Haredi women and I can tell you, Haredi women are the biggest feminists of all.\" Elisheva Epstein (33) is Head of the Development Department at CrediFI ● Monthly salary range: 30-35,000 NIS Translated from article in Hebrew https://www.globes.co.il/news/article.aspx?did=1001264012 By Shiri Dover Dec. 12, 2018 Where am I catching you and what does your job entail? \"I get to work between 6:30 and 7 am, so that I can get back to my three children in time to be with them while they’re still awake.  I am usually the first to arrive but I’m not the only one; there are also fathers who like to get home at a sane hour.  But I’m flexible about the time I leave, it depends on my work load.  The vision of CrediFI is to bring transparency into the world of real estate in the US.  After the market collapsed in 2008, investors came up with the idea to make the market less opaque and more transparent.  We collect data from all over the world and analyze it.  Our customers are regulators such as large banks in the US.  I manage the development team which is comprised of 10 people, including three developers and three customer service agents.  We are now in the process of recruiting and expanding our team of staff.” How long have you been in the company and what did you do before? \"I previously worked at Kramer Electronics and have been here for two years.  I decided that I wanted to combine professionalism with my passion and be part of a company that has an impact in the world.  There is a certain thrill that comes along with the pressure and challenge of working for a new, unestablished start-up.  I believe that to have a successful career, you have to have the experience of working for a big company and also for a start-up”. How did you get into the field? \"I studied computer science at a Beit Yaakov seminary and then went on to complete an undergraduate degree at the Tal Institute of the Lev Academic Center.  During that time I also worked as a counsellor for American students who were spending a year learning in Israel.  After that I worked for a company that creates software solutions and I got into project management with customers.  From there I moved on to working for a start-up.” Did you always know that this was what you wanted to do? \"Yes.  Already from the ninth grade I started studying computers and loved it.  I then went on to study at a Torah-based college.\" Are you religious or Haredi (ultra-Orthodox)? I’m Haredi.  But in the professional world, I look at people as professionals.  Whether they are a man, a woman, an Arab, a Jew, religious or secular is irrelevant.”  I do my best to uphold this standard even when I’m interviewing people.  People often judge and categorize others based on stereotypes and what they know from their own social background, but it’s not right to do that.” Do you feel like people try to categorize you? \"When I’m interviewing people a man might come in and say, 'Oh, so you’re from Human Resources?'\" Of course he is assuming this because I’m a woman.  It’s a malady that I think everyone has, and it has nothing to do with which sector of society.  In fact, this scenario happens more often with some of the most liberal people.  Even when I was interviewed, my employers tried to guess the age of my children and assumed that the next one was already on its way.  Women in tech-tech need to be pushier.” Can you be Haredi and feminist? \"Sure, why not? Haredi women are the biggest feminists of all, after all they are the breadwinners. Compare a Haredi woman to any non-religious woman and you will see that the Haredi woman carries a much heavier load. I also believe that women put themselves under a glass ceiling”. Where do you think you’ll be in five years from now? \"I want to start my own start-up company with a few of my good friends, or be an R & D Manager at a start-up.” share in social medias: Previous Update Next Update More Updates Where does Israel go from here?

Israel Defense Prize for JCT Alum (1) for his role in detecting Hamas tunnels 12.7.2018 Col. Yaniv Avitan, a graduate of the Jerusalem College of Technology’s (JCT) Electro-Optics Engineering Department, received the 2018 Israel Defense Prize from the Israeli Ministry of Defense for his role heading a team that works to detect the Hamas terror group’s cross-border attack tunnels. This marks the second consecutive year and the fourth time in the past decade that a JCT graduate has received this prestigious award. Avitan is head of the Collection and Assault Unit of the Technological Division of the Ground Forces of the Israel Defense Forces (IDF). His team developed \"The Brain\" which is a nickname for the laboratory they established in 2016 and in the last two years has located nine of Hamas’s underground tunnels that were dug from the Gaza Strip into Israeli territory. The team includes experts from the IDF, the Ministry of Defense, academic institutions, and the defense industry. As modern electro-optics applications are increasingly implemented in electronics, modern communications, medicine, data processing, energy, and especially the security field, JCT’s electro-optics department prepares professionals for R&D work by providing them with a strong foundation in applied physics, electronics, and computers. Graduates of the electro-optics program master the planning of optical systems and instruments, lasers and other light sources, photoelectric light detectors, electro-optic light modulation, holography, devices for television photography as well as night vision devices, and computer assisted lens design. The threat of Hamas’s cross-border tunnel network was particularly prominent during Israel’s 2014 summer war in Gaza. The IDF destroyed more than 30 of the so-called “terror tunnels” during that conflict, but the military continues to discover and dismantle the tunnels today, several years after Operation Protective Edge. Avitan, aged 42, grew up in Netivot and lives in Sderot, both situated in southern Israel near the Gaza border—meaning the tunnel threat and other forms of terrorism have long been a reality of his daily life. He has researched the Hamas tunnels since 2013. “We developed an algorithm into which data was fed, combined with assessments of the security situation and decisions about where to drill, where to dig, where to attack, and what to handle,” says Avitan. “The breakthrough was not only technological, but also in the way people worked - technology professionals left their laboratories and went out in the field, in complete contrast to the norms of their military service. Various defense industries joined the Lab. There were great challenges, but everyone went full steam ahead. We are pretty confident in the method. It speaks for itself when it comes to locating tunnels.” Avitan calls his team’s tunnel-detection breakthrough “a highlight of my career.” When asked why he chose to stay in the army when using his skills to develop a start-up could potentially make him millions, Avitan simply stated that the fields outside of the army \"can't provide the sense of meaning that IDF service offers.\" “The most dramatic moment was the first time the system proved itself,” he recalls. “You hit the tunnel and it’s very exciting. As a resident of the area, I understand very well what this means for civilians. The tunnel that we most recently detected (about a month ago) threatened the lives of IDF soldiers and residents of the Gaza vicinity. It was discovered a short distance from where my family lives.\" share in social medias: Previous Update Next Update More Updates Where does Israel go from here?

JCT has outsized presence at Israel’s Cyber Challenge Home Page News and Updates ... JCT has outsized presence at Israel’s Cyber Challenge 4.7.2018 At the Tel Aviv University Cyber Week, only 90 contestants from all over the country managed to enter the final stage of the Cyber Challenge contest — and 18 of them belong to JCT's Cyber Elite program! All 3 finalists were women from JCT's Cyber Elite program. Eighteen religious men and women who are part of the Jerusalem College of Technology’s (JCT) Cyber Elite program were among the 90 competitors in the national Cyber Challenge competition, held at Tel Aviv University during Israel’s national Cyber Week from June 17-21. \" Cyber Week is a large annual international cybersecurity event, hosted each year at Tel Aviv University in Israel. Over the past eight years, Cyber Week has become internationally acclaimed as one of the top cybersecurity events in the world.\" Cyber Elite opens new doors for haredi and national-religious Israelis, who previously had virtually no access to cyber careers because the primary path to that industry in Israel is participation in cyber units within the military. So Cyber Elite provides intensive cyber training to outstanding graduates of JCT’s degrees in software engineering and computer science, while simultaneously placing them in cyber departments of multinational, aerospace, and defense companies as well as in cyber startups. Cyber ​​Elite is a partnership between JCT’s Lev Academic Center, the Rashi Foundation’s Cyber ​​Education Center, and the National Cyber ​​Directorate of the Israeli Prime Minister’s Office. The program was developed in collaboration with senior executives in Israel’s cyber industry, and its courses combine theory with hands-on experience, in accordance with the needs of the defense and civil industries. The program is part of JCT’s broader mission to empower religious Israelis through science and technology education, as 4,500 haredi and religious students study at the college’s Lev Academic Center. JCT trains 18 percent of Israel’s women computer science students. It comes as no surprise, therefore, that Cyber Elite students represented one-fifth of all competitors in the final stage of this week’s Cyber Challenge. The 18 Cyber Elite participants who reached the six-hour final round were chosen from among 400 candidates from across Israel who took part in an online preliminary screening stage in May. Only three women qualified for the final stage—all of them from Cyber Elite. Yehiel Levin , a 29-year-old haredi father of two who studied computer science at the JCT, was among the Cyber Challenge competitors from the Cyber Elite program. As part of the program he works as a student in the research-and-development department of a company that monitors and identifies computer network threats, and after completing Cyber Elite, he is expected to continue working for that company in a full-time position. “I would not have been be able to get a job like this without Cyber Elite, no matter how talented or professional I was,” Levin said. “The skills we acquired and the connections we made with the cyber industry this year enabled me to get to where I am today. Only a select few got accepted into Cyber Elite which was an 11-month-long pilot program for 31 students—16 men and 15 women—that JCT hopes to continue and grow. The initiative has given Israeli companies access to previously untapped talent in the religious community. “The program provides an opportunity for secular business leaders to get acquainted with the religious and haredi sectors,” said Levin. “There is also a huge change taking place in the haredi public. When I went to school, it was not easy to explain to people why I was going to pursue such a career. But over the years, I have seen a greater understanding in the haredi community. Even when there is no agreement, there is much more acceptance of my path as a professional.” Moshe Gowers , 32, began studying secular subjects a decade ago after previously only learning in a yeshiva environment. A computer science student at the Lev Academic Center, he began working as a developer and programmer until joining Cyber ​​Elite, where he studied cyber security and hacking. “In the Cyber Challenge competition in particular, and in cyberspace in general, you have to think outside the box,” Gowers said. “During the contest, we were able to cope with challenges we tackled throughout the year as part of Cyber Elite, to solve things and to deal with new tasks,” added Levin. “In cyberspace, there will always be something new to learn and try.” share in social medias: Previous Update Next Update More Updates Where does Israel go from here?

Collaborate on Innovative Nursing Program Home Page News and Updates ... JCT and Toronto U. Collaborate on Innovative Nursing Program 10.6.2018 When leading academic institutions across continents partner on interdisciplinary innovation, that is a groundbreaking development. When such innovation also counters socioeconomic, religious, and gender stereotypes, it is that much more powerful. Israel has long drawn strength and inspiration from political and diplomatic supporters in Canada. But there are other key ways in which Canada proves itself an overseas ally for the Jewish state. One area where our countries work so well together is in developing strategic partnerships via academic collaboration. For example, partnering with the University of Toronto’s Institute of Health Policy, Management and Evaluation (IHPME) has helped the Jerusalem College of Technology (JCT) develop Israel’s first program in health informatics, a cutting-edge field that aims to improve the quality of patient care by utilizing data as the basis for making better clinical decisions. This highly fruitful match between academic institutions, facilitated by Judith Shamian, past president of the International Council of Nurses and a member of JCT’s board of trustees, has led to the development of a master’s program primarily aimed at women studying nursing at JCT, whose nursing department had already been recognized by Israel’s Ministry of Health as the country’s best of its kind. The quality of today’s health care hinges on, among other factors, practitioners’ ability to work in an environment that constantly incorporates new technologies. That is where health informatics comes into the picture, creating a new generation of tech-savvy nurses and other health professionals who make sound, data-informed decisions. JCT’s nursing graduates have a pass rate of virtually 100 per cent every year on national accreditation exams – the highest scores in Israel. Among the 900 students studying toward nursing degrees at JCT, there are more than 450 haredim, nearly 200 new immigrants, and over 30 Ethiopian-Israelis. In addition to the health informatics program, JCT’s nursing department offers a geriatric nurse practitioner’s certification course, a program to enrich students’ orthopaedic experience as part of their surgical training, and a forthcoming paramedic certification program. That’s why U of T chose Israel’s largest and most prestigious nursing program for this trailblazing partnership. On a broader level, JCT creates a more inclusive and harmonious Israel through the college’s commitment to providing high-quality academics to religious women and men alike. As the driving force behind the integration of religious Israelis into the country’s workforce, JCT reduces their dependence on government support and helps them become more active participants in Israeli society. JCT provides all of its students with a learning environment that simultaneously meets their religious needs and focuses on secular subjects that lead to professional career development. This meets a crucial need in Israel, whose Central Bureau of Statistics found that about 50 per cent of haredi men were employed by the end of last year. JCT inverts the plot line, with its haredi graduates attaining an 89 per cent employment rate, including 77 per cent in their field of choice. Among the 1,000 Israeli haredim who studied computer science in 2017, two-thirds of them studied at JCT. This institutional mission is a vital recognition of Israel’s demographic reality. The country’s haredi fertility rate is 6.9 children per woman, compared to 2.4 per non-haredi woman, according to the Central Bureau of Statistics. The haredi community, which currently makes up 9 per cent of Israel’s total population, is projected to comprise 16 per cent of the population by 2030 and about one-third by 2065. This means that the importance of training and employing religious Israelis will continue to rise. JCT is crafting a new and exciting story for Israel – one that shatters stereotypes by featuring the high-level professional contributions of the haredi community, including through advancement in innovative fields such as health informatics. Thanks in no small part to the support of JCT’s Canadian partners, more breakthroughs in this story are surely on the horizon. This article appeared in the Canadian Jewish News.

Questions? ‘Big Bang Theory’ Star Mayim Bialik Headlines JCT Gala Dinner in NYC Home Page News and Updates ... ‘Big Bang Theory’ Star Mayim Bialik Headlines JCT Gala Dinner in NYC 8.5.2018 ‘Big Bang Theory’ Star Mayim Bialik Headlines Jerusalem College of Technology Gala Dinner Last Night in NYC As the dinner’s keynote speaker, Bialik—an observant Jew in Hollywood who plays neurobiologist Amy Farrah Fowler and is herself a neuroscientist—represents a microcosm of the college’s groundbreaking achievements in Israeli society and spoke about her career breaking down barriers Jerusalem, May 7, 2018 — Friends of Jerusalem College of Technology, which rallies support for an academic institution that is at the forefront of empowering women in Israeli society, last night featured “Big Bang Theory” star actress Mayim Bialik as the keynote speaker at its New York City gala dinner. Over 400 people gathered at Lincoln Square Synagogue in Manhattan to hear Bialik and support the Jerusalem College of Technology (JCT) as a key agent of change in Israel through its training of religious women in science and technology careers. Bialik—an observant Jew in Hollywood who plays neurobiologist Amy Farrah Fowler on “Big Bang Theory” and is herself a neuroscientist—was perfectly cast for the role of keynote speaker at the Friends of JCT gala. “What is so incredible about what the Jerusalem College of Technology does, and why I’m so honored to be here, is that I want to see Israel succeed and compete, and I think there is so much misinformation about Israel. Organizations like JCT represent that tension and complexity while really honoring so many of the values that many of us hold true no matter how we identify politically or religiously,” Bialik said. Bialik’s honor at the “JCT - Sparking Innovation” event comes after the college was recently awarded land in Emek Zion, adjacent to its Lev Campus for men, where it is planning to build permanent facilities for the Tal Campus for women. The Tal Campus offers female students a unique combination of science and engineering education on the highest level and advanced Judaic studies courses. In a letter sent to organizers, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu wrote, “For almost 50 years, JCT has been preparing students in the fields of hi-tech engineering, electronics, business management and life and health sciences. JCT graduates help Israel maintain its status as a world leader in technology and innovation. Over the years, JCT’s graduates and faculty have established over 60 hi-tech companies,” PM Netanyahu continued. “The new Tal Campus will provide an opportunity for motivated and talented women interested in combining Judaic and academic studies to realize their potential and develop much-needed expertise in hi-tech and science. I am confident that the future graduates of Tal Campus will continue JCT’s proud tradition and leave their mark on the Israeli economy.” Originally known for playing the title character of NBC’s “Blossom” as a child actress from 1991-1995, Bialik is also a leading voice on women’s issues, including through her New York Times bestseller book “Girling Up: How to Be Strong, Smart and Spectacular.” “It was tremendous to see so many people here that support JCT’s mission and share our vision for the future of Israel. Mayim Bialik’s unique personal and professional story is a microcosm of JCT’s own narrative in Israeli society and the global Jewish community,” said Friends of JCT Chairman Aurora Cassirer. “Both in real life and on the television screen, she helps counter the myth that women are not as well-suited as men for science and technology careers, all while maintaining an observant Jewish lifestyle. Mayim is a special role model for Jewish women, and we could not think of a more fitting and inspirational keynote speaker for JCT.” JCT’s groundbreaking work in the education of women in technology fields is particularly apparent when it comes to computer science. One out of every five Israeli women studying computers does so at JCT, and all of those students are daati leumi (national religious) or haredi. Fifty-three percent of JCT’s computer science students are women—18 percent higher than any other Israeli institution of higher learning. The Friends of JCT gala also included a tribute to Dr. Rozalie Schachter, the daughter of Satmar Chassidim, who emigrated to the U.S. at the age of 16, obtained a Ph.D. in Physics from New York University and became a trailblazer for women in the field of technology and business, as well as Golan Ben Oni, Chief Information Officer at IDT, who was granted the Shield of David award. share in social medias: Previous Update Next Update More Updates Where does Israel go from here?

This background makes the topic of this essay, the binding and near sacrifice of Isaac, a very personal one. The tension between the centrality of sacrifice in our tradition, on the one hand, and the emphasis on continuing life, on the other, is fundamental to her identity. Dr. Zitter views with awe and love the insistence on continuing life that her mother, rebuilder of a Jewish family, exemplified. This essay is dedicated to the whole family, those who were murdered and those who survived in the sanctification of G-d’s Name. ejzitter@yahoo.com Back to Table of Contents share in social medias: Previous Update Next Update More Updates Where does Israel go from here?

Haredi Women Know The Secret for Success in Hi-Tech Home Page News and Updates ... Haredi Women Know The Secret for Success in Hi-Tech 10.4.2018 Haredi Women Know The Secret for Success in Hi-Tech While Israel considers \"importing\" hi-tech employees from India, Haredi women are flocking to computer science fields ■ Estimates show that within 20 years, Haredi women will comprise 30%-40% of all hi-tech students in Israel Eti Stern and Sara Ganot The subject of Haredi women in hi-tech provides important insights into integration into employment, productivity, social arrangements between sectors, and the rifts in Israeli society. Haredi women appear to be doubly disadvantaged: as women and as part of a minority group, but they are flourishing in the fields of software engineering and computer science, which are considered to be \"masculine\" professions. This is no coincidence and we want to find the reason for it . There are several known anomalies in the Israeli economy and workforce – the measure of academic degrees is among the highest in the world, together with high employment rates, but productivity is falling behind. Despite the existing talent, there is a severe shortage of professionals in the field of engineering and other sought after professions, so much so that the country considered 'importing' engineers from India. In addition, there are populations that do not integrate into the workforce due to social and religious reasons, which creates a burden on the welfare system. The state spent a fortune to bring about change – but these changes were performed in a disorganized manner and were costly . There is, however, another way, as is the case with Haredi women in hi-tech. According to data collected by the Council for Higher Education and published in TheMarker, the percentage of women studying towards computer science degrees is significantly lower than that of men; women comprise 28% of all students in computer science. On the other hand, the Jerusalem College of Technology (JCT) – Lev Academic Center has a majority of 53% of women in computer science studies. Haredi women flock to computer science, and according to estimates by academic researchers, in 20 years they will be 30%-40% of all students in hi-tech fields in Israel . In our experience, the reason for this is practical: Haredi women have no interest in traditional professions that are not in demand, nor do they seek \"self-realization\" in non-economic fields, but rather seek a profession that will enable them to make a decent living for their family where they can work without having to abandon their religious lifestyle. Their success in integrating into the workforce is very impressive: Haredi women in hi-tech work in programming, and research and development in leading hi-tech companies. About 90% of our Haredi women graduates join the profession within six months of graduation and receive additional tools and training in order to overcome any difficulties they might face when seeking to enter the workforce. The education of women in the Haredi society differs from that of men, as does the social expectation. However, the expectation from a Haredi woman to support a household is a common phenomenon and therefore their integration into the computer professions can help many families escape the cycle out of poverty. Therefore, women from other sectors in Israel should know - there is no reason to avoid computer science. Due to the high demand for employees, the bargaining position of the employee is stronger than that of the employer, the wage is higher than average and the job search period is shorter. When women integrate and succeed in hi-tech occupations, it opens opportunities for other women, as well as men (Haredi). Success leads to success and to an increase in productivity. The Israeli economy needs talented men and women in hi-tech so we can maintain Israel's status as a global hi-tech powerhouse .

A New Solution for Diabetes 25.12.2017 Prof. Uziel Sandler and Dr. Yoram Dvari, two JCT researchers, are currently developing an innovative and revolutionary solution for diabetics. The current treatment for diabetics, injecting insulin into the body, does not provide a satisfactory solution for all patients . APC1, the new medication, allows sugar to be transferred through the body more effectively, making it easier for the body to produce insulin without assistance. The major benefit of this medication is that it doesn't require an insulin injection but encourages the body to produce it on its own . The development of APC1 began three years ago and has shown positive results in animal testing. Within a few months, after proving its effectiveness and harmlessness, human trials will begin, and based upon their success, the medication will be presented to the FDA for approval . share in social medias: Previous Update Next Update More Updates Where does Israel go from here?

LevTech aims to expand opportunities for religious men and women by providing them with the tools to develop their entrepreneurial skills and enable them to open their own businesses or to be entrepreneurial within larger companies. LevTech consists of a pre-accelerator (LevTech LAB), internal and external hackathon (technology marathons) preparation and participation, as well as activities for encouraging creative thinking. Hackathons, campus-wide special lectures and creative thinking workshops are open to all JCT students. LevTech LAB is a semester-long program consisting of 3-hour weekly classes providing those with innovative ideas with the opportunities and resources to develop their ventures. After screening dozens of projects from students as well as graduates of JCT's business and engineering departments, 30 students and graduates were accepted into the LevTech LAB pre-accelerator program. Subjects covered include: market research, product differentiation, business models, legal and regulatory aspects of starting a business, fundraising, negotiations and networking, marketing, and product-market fit, as well as presentations and an elevator pitch. In addition to the classes, students will be mentored by entrepreneurs in the field as well as technical mentors. JCT worked with JCT’s Student Union to invite the Mayor of Jerusalem, Mr. Nir Barkat, to the LevTech opening event in order to share his experience as an entrepreneur and a venture capitalist. During the event, Mayor Barkat shared his personal story and discussed how his entrepreneurial background has guided his activities and vision as Mayor of Jerusalem.

However students should check with specific colleges as each has different requirements for transfer credits. Questions? Concern for their Future Home Page News and Updates ... Concern for their Future Prof. Chaim Sukenik for Maariv 26.10.2017 This article originally appeared in Hebrew in Maariv,  a leading Israeli newspaper. The recent decrease in the percentage of Haredi employment demands a new strategy. Creating a new reality wherein Haredim choose to study towards degrees in computers and engineering instead of education and law may just do the trick. Today, the academic school year will open following disconcerting data recently published by the Chief Economist of the Ministry of Finance, which estimates that from the end of 2015 to the second quarter of 2017, there was a decrease in the rate of employment of Haredi men. This follows years of a steady increase in their integration into academia and the workforce, and after a significant overall shift in the Haredi community in 2015, such that for the first time the percentage of men working surpassed the percentage of full time Yeshiva students. Whereas the explanation provided by the Ministry of Finance relied on changes in incentives provided to Haredim, it seems reasonable to suggest that the problem lies in the fact that government policies and programs for Haredi integration into academia have not evolved over the years. After many years wherein the emphasis was placed on setting quantitative targets for the integration of Haredim into academia, the realization that a change is necessary should have been understood, and the emphasis should have shifted to integration into quality professions. It is reasonable to suggest that a policy wherein Haredim were continually encouraged to seek professions with inadequate demand and relatively low salaries slowed the integration process. In order to prevent this decrease from becoming a trend that will cause Israeli society in general, and the Haredi sector in particular, to regress, it is important that the country formulate a strategy that will focus on quality job placement and thus better utilize the potential of the Haredi community. Integrating Haredim into professions with high demand and high salary potential such as engineering, hi-tech and computers, will ensure that Haredi families can leave poverty behind. This shift will provide the incentive for the Haredi community to integrate, regardless of the political battles surrounding governmental financial incentives. From my years of experience with the Haredi sector, I have observed their vast potential. I am convinced that their high work ethic and creativity will fuel the success of such an initiative. This new strategy must concentrate on two essential aspects. Firstly, we must encourage Haredim to select the right field of study. We must change the reality in which the majority of Haredim choose to study education and/or law. These fields are flooded and the demand and earning potential are low. It is true that they are the more convenient courses of study for Haredim in that they require less work to overcome cultural and academic gaps, however, experience has shown that choosing these “easy” pathways is shortsighted. The second aspect is placement following graduation. Studies show that in both their initial acceptance into the workplace and afterwards, there is discrimination against Haredim when compared to non-religious applicants due to preconceived notions and stereotypes. The frequently heard argument that the variation in salary between Haredim and secular employees stems from differences in the level of training and professionalism, is completely unfounded. Our hundreds of Haredi graduates who integrate within the world of engineering and hi-tech in leading Israeli and multi-national companies are clear evidence of that. The forecasts regarding the growth of the Haredi community and its increasing influence on the Israeli market leave no room for doubt regarding the importance of integrating them into academia and the workforce. We must treat the data published by the Ministry of Finance as a wakeup call. The author is the president of the Jerusalem College of Technology, in which over 1,500 Haredi students study computer science, hi-tech and engineering. share in social medias: Previous Update Next Update More Updates Where does Israel go from here?

JCT Graduate Wins Marketing “Oscar” 9.7.2017 JCT Graduate Wins Marketing “Oscar” Yair Schrader, a graduate of JCT’s Business and Management Faculty, was awarded the “Oscar” for marketing and media activation at the “Festival of Media Global” held in Rome for “Best Sponsorship Activation”. The award is considered the “Oscar” for marketing and media activation, in which hundreds of campaigns from around the globe compete annually. His campaign, which was the only Israeli campaign to reach the finals, beat other international brands including, inter alia, Coca-Cola, Google, and Unilever. Yair received the award for his “New Head Coach” campaign for Head & Shoulders’ branding in Israel. The campaign had a timely release last year with Maccabi Tel Aviv’s basketball team when, following a loss at the semi-finals, the team’s coach was fired. The campaign was launched immediately after his dismissal so that an article about the coach being let go included ads in which the coach’s supposed replacement, NBA’s Teddy Brown, announces what all the players really need is the brand’s shampoo. The campaign also included distribution of hats to fans during the game which indicated whether or not the fans had dandruff. Yair began working at Head & Shoulders as an intern several years ago after presenting his CV to the company during a job fair organized by JCT’s Placement Department. Upon completing his studies, he was promoted to Brand Manager, a position which he has held for over a year. share in social medias: Previous Update Next Update More Updates Where does Israel go from here?

JCT Holds First Digital Job Fair 27.6.2017 JCT Holds First Digital Job Fair Dozens of Israel's leading hi-tech and engineering companies, and close to 500 students and graduates, both men and women, participated in Israel’s first Digital Job Fair which was held on JCT’s Lev Campus in early June. The revolutionary fair utilized an app designed specifically for the event by ICV. Students and graduates created profiles on the app and immediately received a list of companies and organizations most applicable to them in accordance with their specified preferences. Potential employers were ranked according to the compatibility with the job seeker's preferences. The app also assessed favorability of each company for the applicant according to travel time via private and public transportation, factoring in morning traffic, as well as  their qualifications and additional professional demands. Using the app, applicants were able to focus on companies for which they were most compatible, increasing their potential of finding employment. Employers received applicant stats in real-time and could call them infor interviews with a push of a button. This saved wasted paper both for the employers and applicants, while enabling employers to receive all relevant information, and served as an effective filtering and communication tool for the employers. Director of the Placement Department at JCT, Yael Gandman, stated at the event: \"There is no reason for high-tech professionals in Israel to spend six months looking for work when the demand for employees is so high.  The recruitment process should take closer to two weeks.\" Companies and start-ups seeking employees at the fair included, inter alia, Exlibris, ORCAM, Quickode, Kenshoo, Experis Software, Ness, Israel Aerospace Industries, John Bryce, Gav Systems, Log-on, and INNITEL, as well as CPA companies including, inter alia,  BDO Ziv Haft,  KPMG, EY, Ernst and Young , BDSK, Tzur Management, and Mizrahi Tefahot . share in social medias: Previous Update Next Update More Updates Where does Israel go from here?

The Conference, initiated by JCT, Bar-Ilan University and Yeshiva University, has become a mainstay of all Torah-Science related content in Israel. The Conference concentrated on the combination of Torah and Scientific knowledge in various fields of science, from earth and technology, to sociology and humanities, and its effects on everyday life. In a series of short lectures, the speakers addressed questions such as: Will meat from stem cells, a new advancement that is expected to hit the market in several years, be kosher? And will it be pareve or meat? JCT's Head of the Batei Midrash, Rav Yosef Zvi Rimon, discussed the potential halachic issues related to a Smart Home which will have to address homes that identify the people in the room and adjust the temperature and other settings according to the person's habits, or homes operated by speech or sight. He added, \"We cannot fear innovation. Sometimes new inventions can facilitate the observance of halacha. For instance, in a Smart Home, the refrigerator can be pre-programmed according to the beginning and end of Shabbatot and Chagim, preventing the light from turning on on Shabbat.\" The Lev Prize for Torah and Science was presented during the event to Prof. Ely Merzbach from Bar Ilan University for his research and unique contribution to Torah and Science. Those previously awarded the prize include Rabbi Yisrael Rosen, Dr. Yitzhak Nebenzahl, Rabbi Dr. Eliyahu Zaini and Nobel Prize winner Prof. Yisrael Aumann. share in social medias: Previous Update Next Update More Updates Where does Israel go from here?

Questions? 95% of Foreign Students at JCT Remain in Israel Home Page News and Updates ... 95% of Foreign Students at JCT Remain in Israel 6.3.2017 Academia and Zionism go hand-in-hand at the Jerusalem College of Technology (JCT) – Lev Academic Center. This week, a special delegation from JCT completed a marathon of events for young Jews living in France who are interested in academic studies in Israel. Binyamin Touati, who led the delegation, noted, with satisfaction, that 140 of the participants expressed great interest in coming to Israel and studying at JCT, and hundreds more also expressed particular interest. The delegation participated in events in Marseilles and Paris, Lyon and Antwerp (Belgium), where they presented members of the Jewish community with information on Israel and JCT's unique programs. Academic studies seem to have a significant effect on the graduates. 95% of graduates from abroad make Aliyah and continue living in Israel. 93% of JCT immigrant graduates find work in Israel, similar to the general placement rates of JCT graduates. JCT has run a special program for foreign students and immigrants for the past 20 years. This year, approximately 130 students are from French-speaking countries whilst others are tourists and immigrants from across the globe. The young immigrants even enlist in the IDF after graduation, serving in their fields of study, particularly in high-tech. JCT President, Prof. Chaim Sukenik, explains: \"Zionism and academic excellence and the synergy of Torah and science, guide JCT's activities. Part of the process of redemption is the ingathering of the exiles of Israel. As someone who made Aliya decades ago, I feel that it is a privilege as well as a duty for us to care for the young generation of the diaspora and return them to Israel.\" Binyamin Touati, a JCT graduate himself, views it as a Zionist mission: \"There is great interest among French Jews to come and study in Israel, in Yeshivas, universities, and/or serving as counselors in youth movements. It is important to encourage the Jews in France to make Aliya. I view it not only as an academic mission but as a Zionist mission.\" share in social medias: Previous Update Next Update More Updates Where does Israel go from here?

Two JCT Students Win Prizes from the CHE 6.3.2017 Two JCT Students Win Prizes from the CHE In early February, two JCT students received the Shosh Berlinski Prize for Social involvement in the Community from the Council for Higher Education (CHE). This prestigious annual prize is only awarded to ten students from all institutions of higher education in Israel. The students won the prize, as well as a scholarship for NIS10,000, for their endeavors as part of JCT's Lev Bakehila social project. Loui Orka is an immigrant from Ethiopia, the second oldest from a family of 12. Loui has been volunteering at the Jewish Institute for the Blind in Jerusalem for two years. He taught the children to swim and ensured their safety while in the pool, however, he provided them with much more than that by conducting one-on-one talks, providing support, and giving encouragement and unconditional love to the children, who were eager to share their feelings with Loui and to learn knew terms as well as life skills. Shaul Horwitz volunteers with two people with special needs: a young autistic man who lives alone, and a 55 year old with cognitive and emotional disabilities. He managed to gain their trust and friendship and was able to communicate with them in a way in which no one, including professionals, has previously managed to do. When granting the two with the prize, Prof. Sukenik stated that \"alongside the success and significant academic achievements, we believe it is important to introduce our students to the outside world and to connect with the community.\" \"We view people with disabilities as deserving of equal rights and treat them as equals,\" explains Program Manager Zvika Orr,\" and we do everything in our power to help them feel fulfilled and bring their unique contribution to Israeli society. \" \"Lev Bakehila\" (Lev in the Community) is JCT's flagship civic engagement program focusing on the promotion of human rights of people with disabilities, such as, inter alia, housing rights, education, employment, accessibility, due process, and equality. Over fifty students and faculty participate in the program each year. Students undergo practical and theoretical-academic training. Lectures are provided by professionals in each of the areas of activity of the center.

JCT Student Research at the Annual Sociology Conference 6.3.2017 Research Conducted by JCT Student Presented at the Annual Sociology Conference Shaul Horwitz, a third year nursing student at the Jerusalem College of Technology (JCT) – Lev Academic Center, conducted innovative research as part of his work in connection with the honors program, supervised by Zvika Orr and Dr. Adi Finkelstein. The study was presented during the annual conference of the Israel Sociology Society, which took place on the Open University's Ra'anana Campus. This is the largest and most prestigious conference in the field of sociology in Israel, attracting major researchers from Israel and abroad. The study was presented by Shaul Horwitz during a panel on the subject of disability studies. The study dealt with the processes of recognizing a disability resulting from chronic disorder, by examining the case of fibromyalgia and chronic fatigue. These disorders are chronic disorders that restrict patient function, however, no known medical source has been found, and consensus has yet to be reached regarding methods of diagnosis. While many countries have already recognized these and similar disorders, patients in Israel face many obstacles such as not receiving medical diagnosis and benefits. The study sheds new light regarding the manner in which society and the Israeli and international body politic deal with chronic patients in general and with medical ambiguity in particular. The paper written by Shaul Horwitz, Zvika Orr and Dr. Adi Finkelstein, suggests policy methods that may improve the patients' quality of life. Later this year, Shaul plans to submit the study to an international journal. share in social medias: Previous Update Next Update More Updates Where does Israel go from here?

JCT holds first hackathon 16.1.2017 JCT Holds First Hackathon Based on an article that appeared on the Arutz Sheva Website, for the original in Hebrew, click here During Chanukah, JCT’s student union held its first Hackathon, in which dozens of students competed for 48 hours straight, creating technological solutions for challenges facing companies and organizations. Students were presented with several ‘problems’ for which they were to provide solutions. These included developing a system to help children in electric wheelchairs avoid crashing into objects or walls; preventing injuries on construction sites; sharing information with customers in real-time regarding the availability of products in automated machines, retail chains and stores; and providing a solution for emergency services whose personnel have difficulty treating injured people due to language barriers. After three sleepless days and nights, awards were presented by judges from the top accelerators in Jerusalem ( MassChallenge, Siftech/fresh.fund, OurCrowd ) as well as from Cisco. The judges, as well as those in charge of the hi-tech ecosystem in Jerusalem, were very impressed with the creativity of the students and their advanced ability to solve problems quickly.  The judges included: Doron Ish Shalom (MassChallenge), David Wachtfogel (Cisco Systems), Nitzan Adler (Siftech/fresh.fund ), Pini Lozowick (OurCrowd) and Zaki Djemal (Tzvi.vc). Organizations who participated in the event included Safeguard, Alyn, United Hatzalah of Israel, Quickode, Shalva, Audyx , and Glide . The winning projects included \"Pronto,\" an app that eliminates the need for standing in line at supermarkets, \"Unlimited Chairs,\" which prevents electric wheelchairs from falling down stairs or crashing into various obstacles, and \"In Time for Bus,\" an app that uses smart cameras to alert staff at a special needs program regarding the arrival of their students.   MassChallenge has already approached one of the winners to develop their project and another company immediately offered a student a job. Following the event, David Wachtfogel , a judge from Cisco, stated: \"The Hackathon was extremely impressive. The students developed great projects, and broke through technological boundaries. This is an example of how we can build technological abilities in Jerusalem, and I hope that start-ups will emerge from here that will contribute to the economic development of Israel. These are practical solutions that can certainly be implemented. This has great value to thousands of people.\" Stuart Hershkowitz , Vice-President of JCT – Lev Academic Center, congratulated the students on developing the unique projects and said: \"We hope to make this a regular event at JCT, encouraging and strengthening JCT's connections with industry, in order to enable students to succeed in academia and later in top jobs in industry.\" Tomer Ashtar , Vice-Chairman of the Student Union and the initiator of the Hackathon stated: \"The event is the first step in the Student Union's exciting plans. In the near future, the Student Union will endeavor to establish an entrepreneurship center at Lev Campus in collaboration with the Jerusalem College of Technology – Lev Academic Center, which will serve as a meeting point for the great minds among the students. Participants will receive mentoring and lectures from best in the industry, and will strongly connect them to Jerusalem's tech ecosystem, in order to both promote individual projects and to contribute to the community. \" share in social medias: Previous Update Next Update More Updates Where does Israel go from here?

Now, through the use of computers, it has been possible to find codes with a high “statistical” significance in practically every text with enough letters. Now, also, Christians have found codes in Scripture supporting their doctrine, and Michael Drosnin has bewildered the world with his best-selling book The Bible Code .

Haredi Women Leading Social Revolution JPost on the contribution of JCT to this trend 5.12.2016 By Eliana Rudee/JNS.org Haredi, women, and high-tech: three words you never expected to exist harmoniously in the same sentence. And yet, in the Jewish state, these three are a match made in the Garden of Eden. In Israel, the hottest social debate continues over the economic effect of Israel’s religious population and what should be done to ameliorate the resulting economic pressure on haredi families and on the state. These discussions and subsequent laws have encouraged many haredim to seek work where many were previously opposed, as work takes time away from men’s commandment of Torah study and women’s duty to take care of the family and home. However, as the haredi lifestyle with plenty of kids and a minimal earned salary becomes less viable, haredi rabbis have granted approval for many men and women to enter the workforce, leading to a rapid increase of employment among the haredi sector. Women, in particular, are leading this revolution within the community, as they are often required to be the family breadwinners so their husbands can continue to fulfill the commandment of Jewish learning.

Despite the significant success of the previous five-year-plan, some oppose its renewal. The majority of the discussion revolves around the continued existence of gender-separate campuses, which today house the majority of Haredi students. The arguments of the opposition reveal that they lack familiarity with the characteristics and mentality of the Haredi community as well as the existing reality, since the action they seek will undoubtedly incur the return to isolation of the Haredi sector and impede the continued integration of this community into Israeli society.\" Click here to read Prof. Chaim Sukenik, President of JCT's piece in TheMarker Click here to read Vice Preisident Stuart Hershkowitz's piece in Globes Click here to read Vice President Stuart Hershkowitz's piece in Haaretz Click here to read Vice President Stuart Hershkowitz's piece in JPost share in social medias: Previous Update Next Update More Updates Where does Israel go from here?

Demo Day for 2nd Cycle of Yazam BaLev Accelerator Home Page News and Updates ... Demo Day for 2nd Cycle of Yazam BaLev Accelerator 23.3.2016 ntel Software Manager to Haredi Entrepreneurs: \"The question today is no longer whether man is better than beast but whether man is better than the machine?\" Entrepreneurs, venture capital investors and hi-tech and technology personnel participated in early March in a \"demo day\" for the \"Yazam BaLev\" Accelerator program. Dozens of entrepreneurs, venture capital investors, private investors and hi-tech and technology personnel from a variety of companies participated in the “demo day” for the Jerusalem College of Technology (JCT) – Lev Academic Center's, \"Yazam BaLev\" accelerator program for encouraging entrepreneurship among Haredim. The Yazam BaLev accelerator provides Haredi entrepreneurs, even those in very early stages of their venture, with the tools they need to develop their ideas and transform them into viable products and startup companies. As part of the accelerator, the entrepreneurs receive one-on-one guidance and mentoring from top executives and investors from the hi-tech community to help them launch, fund and expand their startups.  The program which has been developed understanding the special needs of the Haredi community, helps them  with any lack of background in technology and education, as well as any marketing difficulties. The Software Manager of the Perceptual Computing Group at Intel Corporation, Yishai Fraenkel, who also serves as a member of the Planning and Budgeting Committee of the Council for Higher Education, stated during the event: \"I exchanged several words with the entrepreneurs and saw beautiful and fascinating ventures…We are currently in a period that was inconceivable for us to reach; computers and electronics that so closely emulate artificial intelligence. Today, there is no question that the field of Computer Sciences will change the world, and the question may no longer be whether 'man is better than beast but whether man is better than the machine?' In most cases, the people leading the startups have already integrated into the Computer Science world - people who have learned a lot, which is what enabled them to become entrepreneurs.\" Mr. Fraenkel added, \"The [Jerusalem College of Technology –] Lev Academic Center is one of the central places in Israel working towards the integration of Haredim, both men and women, in the hi-tech and technology fields, and there is nothing which compares to educating people. There is significant effort involved in learning for many years but it leads to much success along the way.\" Participants included, inter alia, Udi Ben Dor, Deputy CEO for the JDA – Jerusalem Development Authority; Helen Wexler, Commissioner of Hi-tech Portfolio at JDA; Dr. Sigal Shelach, Deputy CEO of JDC (Joint Distribution Committee) and CEO of TEVET – a company that seeks to encourage a million Israelis to escape the circle of poverty; Moishe Freedman, CEO of KamaTech; and Yonatan Goldstein, representative of Boston Medical – which provides advanced medical solutions. The Founder of Yazam BaLev and Vice President of the Jerusalem College of Technology (JCT) – Lev Academic Center, Stuart Hershkowitz, stated that nearly 2,000 Haredi students are studying at JCT.  \"We understand the needs of the Haredi community and the challenges that they face upon entering the entrepreneurial world. We established Yazam BaLev in order to encourage entrepreneurship and provide the tools they need in order to succeed.\" During the event, the entrepreneurs presented their ventures. These included, inter alia: a patent for running a hierarchical coding system where the user has full control over creating and controlling codes; an internet based system for managing similar groups with the option of diverting to the most relevant sub-groups with relevant content; an internet arena that connects service providers in various fields and consumers, and enables direct and fast communication; an application that allows residents to report municipal issues in an easy and quick way; an internet arena that allows users to offer real estate transactions to other users - investments are made in the form of a partnership between investors, so that the individual investment sum is relatively low. Ben Weiner, Manager of the Jumpspeed Ventures Fund, who runs Yazam BaLev, said: \"We place emphasis on the entrepreneurs. Unlike other accelerators, the purpose of the program is to teach its participants what they need in order to build a start-up, as well as demonstrating that Haredi entrepreneurs can dream and aspire for success in the entrepreneurial field.\" share in social medias: Previous Update Next Update More Updates Where does Israel go from here?

Community 3.10.2016 Lev Bakehila (Lev in the Community): The promotion of human rights of persons with disabilities in the Haredi community in Jerusalem The flagship community engagement project of the Jerusalem College of Technology – Lev Academic Center With the support of the Council for Higher Education, \"Lev Bakehila\" (Lev in the Community) was established as JCT's flagship civic engagement program focusing on the promotion of human rights of people with disabilities, such as housing rights, education, employment, accessibility, due process, and equality. Students, faculty, and staff assist and empower people with disabilities in the Haredi (ultra-orthodox) communities in Jerusalem, addressing their problems and needs. The project was established and is headed by Dr. Zvika Orr and Dr. Adi Finkelstein from the Department of Nursing. About the project: Background In Jerusalem there are between 27,000 and 50,000 Haredi (ultra-orthodox) people with varying degrees of disability. This group includes people with physical, mental, sensory, developmental, and cognitive disabilities who are, therefore, doubly discriminated against by Israeli society. For example, Haredi people with disabilities have higher unemployment rates and greater economic difficulties both in comparison to the Haredi who are not disabled and to the secular population with disabilities (Alfassi-Henley, 2014). In addition, there is a serious lack of information regarding their rights and the services in place to assist them which is partly due to poor access to information on the Internet and other media. Similarly to people with disabilities from other sectors, members of the Haredi sector with disabilities often experience stigma, shame, and concealment. This flagship community engagement project of the Jerusalem College of Technology (JCT) – Lev Academic Center was established in the spirit of \"the social model of disability\" that views people with disabilities as having a unique contribution to society and seeks to do everything possible to enable them to fulfill this contribution for their benefit, and, no less importantly, for the benefit of all of society. Project Description Students participating in the project promote the rights of Haredi people with disabilities, their integration as equals into society, and their empowerment. 130 students from all JCT’s campuses, including students from the Haredi community and students with disabilities, participate in the project. The project is run by the Department of Nursing but is open to students from all departments at JCT, studying towards bachelor's as well as master's degrees. The students' activities in the community include four hours each week throughout the academic year. Students participating in the project receive a scholarship as well as a certificate acknowledging their participation in the flagship program. In the early months of the year, students attend training that combines practical-professional aspects, such as information regarding human rights in general and the rights of people with disabilities in particular, as well as theoretical-academic aspects, such as basic concepts of disability studies. The training is provided by academic and professional experts (lawyers, social workers, etc.). During the year, additional training on specific topics adapted to the needs of students in the field is carried out. Upon completion of the training, the students select one of following: Individual Level – advancing knowledge and awareness of rights among people with disabilities, their families and their caregivers, guidance and accompaniment in enacting their rights, and their empowerment. Some of the students deal with short-term inquiries while others accompany people and families with multiple needs over a long period of time providing them with in-depth assistance in order to achieve a significant and sustainable change in their lives. Community Leve l – creating community projects that address a need that arises from the community. For example, students identified the need to work with sisters of children with disabilities in a Haredi neighborhood and established a group of sisters with whom they have worked for over a year now. Public Policy Level – activities to alter policies or to create new policies, on both the municipal and national levels, particularly on topics that arise from those dealing with the individual and community levels. On each level, the students can choose between one of two tracks. In the first track, the students can volunteer with civil society organizations that partner with the project (for more details, see under “Partner Organizations”). In the second track, students volunteer in the “Lev Bakehilla” Citizens Rights Center. The Center’s mission is to help Haredi people with disabilities familiarize themselves with and realize their rights. This innovative Rights Center was established in collaboration with the Ezer Mizion Organization’s Family Counseling Center . The Rights Center was established as a result of an in-depth study conducted by the students, under the supervision of the project faculty. Their study used interviews to examine the needs of Haredi people with disabilities and their families, their level of knowledge about their rights, the degree to which they have realized their rights, and the best ways to address their needs and help them promote their rights. The students who volunteer at the Rights Center undergo a comprehensive training by experts in each of its issue areas. The Right Center addresses a wide range of issue areas, including housing, education, employment, accessibility, health services, welfare, due process, equality and more. The Center provides services to people with all kinds of disabilities, free of charge. The student volunteers have an entire network of experts from ten non-governmental and municipal organizations (lawyers, social workers, and others) who advise the students in how to help their clients. To the Rights Center's flyer and contact info, click here. In light of studies that indicate the importance of discussion groups for students, regular group meetings are held for volunteers, where they discuss professional, emotional, and ethical dilemmas that arise from operating activities. The meetings allow reflection and group discussion on the work, the challenges it poses, as well as the benefits and opportunities that arise from it. These meetings also help connect the three levels of activity and the students working within them. The training and group sessions allow to put the students’ activism in the broader social, structural, cultural, economic, and political contexts. The flagship project was built for the long term, taking into consideration the importance of a profound and ongoing relationship with the community and long-term continuous social activism of students and staff together with the community. The project is accompanied by a comprehensive evaluation study, which helps develop the project in an effective manner and to maximize the contribution of the project to all those who participate. The evaluation study is based on a written survey, interviews, and observations. Some nursing students participate in a seminar on health, disability, and human rights. This community-engaged seminar deals with social and cultural aspects of disability and their connection with human rights issues. The seminar is given by Dr. Zvika Orr and Dr. Adi Finkelstein. During the seminar, the students map and analyze social realities relating to the lives of people with disabilities from the Haredi community. The project is generously supported by the Council for Higher Education, PERACH, and (in 2018) the Jewish Community Foundation of Greater MetroWest, NJ.

Long-term goals and planning - Creating a stable, well-established, professional, effective framework for long-term activity, recognized and appreciated by the community, supported by all partners in the process, with consistent activity of students over several years, maintaining continuous operations even during the summer months. - Expanding activists among the students and the community, creating a group of community volunteers, trained by the students, who will volunteer together with the students. - Creating a framework for peer counseling - we conducted a preliminary survey that showed that although the need for this service is decreasing in the general population due to widespread access to information on the Internet, this service will be extremely beneficial to members of the Haredi community, especially with respect to mediation with service providers. - Benefit to students - based on the findings of several studies, we expect that participation in the project will have a positive impact on academic achievement, leadership skills and self-confidence of the students, will raise their motivation to continue studying for advanced degrees, will enhance their chances to succeed in the workforce and enhance their sense of obligation to actively take action for social justice. - Highlighting the links between Judaism and human rights. - Increasing the discourse regarding human rights of persons with disabilities in Israeli society in general and in Haredi society in particular. - Strengthening connections and mutual support between the Jerusalem College of Technology and the ultra-Orthodox community in Jerusalem. - Promoting knowledge and research in the field of disabilities, specifically in relation to the Haredi community. Please contact us: kehila@g.jct.ac.il JCT policy's: The project in the Jerusalem College of Technology's policy The Jerusalem College of Technology decided to consolidate and strengthen the social involvement and active civic participation of students and faculty, and to promote the mutual support between the institution and the community. As an academic-religious institution, the Jerusalem College of Technology wishes to exercise the Jewish values ​​of justice, mercy, \"Love your neighbor as yourself\" and Tikkun Olam (repairing the world). \"On three things the world stands: Torah, work and charity\" (Pirke Avot, FFA MB). We believe that it is our duty as an academic-religious institution not only to provide excellent higher education and religious studies, but also to fulfill our responsibility towards society and create an inherent connection between these elements. The Department of Nursing, leading this flagship project, seeks to realize these values in its academic and practical activities. This project’s activism sharpens the social sensitivity of the nursing students, who play a significant part in this project, and exposes them to issues that are most relevant to their future work. We believe that they can serve as messengers in the future, spreading knowledge and sensitivity in relation to the rights of people with disabilities among health professionals as well as various health institutions in Jerusalem (hospitals, community clinics, etc.). It should be noted that the community engagement is in the area of ​​current research of several faculty members in the Department of Nursing. This allows for maximum utilization of academic resources, enabling high-quality training as well as in-depth and informed social volunteerism, with a broad, comparative and critical perspective. This project is also paramount for the promotion of Haredi society in Israel. The academic education of the Haredi community, men and women, and their entrance into the workforce is one of the central challenges facing contemporary Israel. For 50 years, JCT’s religious environment and its focus on professional career development have attracted orthodox youth interested in studying for an academic degree. Now, the Haredi students are coming to JCT where they are being assisted in becoming contributing members of society as scientists and engineers, in high-tech and in business. In addition, this flagship project enables Haredi students to contribute directly to their community in novel ways. This strengthens the connection between their socio-cultural world and the world of academic studies and employment that they have joined. Participation in the flagship project also provides them with valuable practical experience and strengthens their qualities and skills such as leadership, self-confidence, and motivation. For non-Haredi students, this program provides them with the opportunity to deepen their knowledge of Haredi society and strengthen solidarity among the various groups that make up the Jerusalem College of Technology. The focus of the flagship project in the field of human rights of persons with disabilities also complements the institution's policy, which sets for itself the goal of absorbing and integrating people with disabilities as students, faculty, and staff at the institution and promoting innovative research in the field. We believe, therefore, that the project \"Lev Bakehila\" realizes the values, goals, and vision of the Jerusalem College of Technology. Please contact us: kehila@g.jct.ac.il Partner organizations The project has partners from social organizations specializing in human rights of persons with disabilities and assisting their integration into community life, as well as ultra-Orthodox organizations that support people with disabilities in Haredi society. Partner organizations take an active part in the process of professional-practical training of students, designing and building activities, absorbing volunteering students and execution of the project based on actual needs.

This is a program that provides new startups with all the tools they require in order to realize their ideas and form an actual company. Yuval Virzberg who participated in the first cohort stated: \"Thanks to 'Yazam BaLev' I received a better understanding of start-ups: how to find investors, the process of taking an idea and forming a company and how to write a patent. The program sent me in directions that I hadn't previously considered, both from a professional perspective and in the understanding of the product itself. I learned how to define the problem and build a good and effective business plan. Most importantly  I was able to connect with people in the industry, and the Jerusalem start-up industry in particular. I suggest that everyone who starts out as an entrepreneur, should undergo this process at 'Yazam BaLev.'\" Ben Weiner, the Program Director and Manager of a Venture Capital Fund, explains that this accelerator program, is especially suitable for the religious community. share in social medias: Previous Update Next Update More Updates Where does Israel go from here?

JCT Students Ensure Road Safety 6.1.2016 JCT Students Ensure Road Safety A new model for enforcing speed limits on the roads using cameras was developed by students from JCT's Tal Campus, based on Game Theory. An experiment was conducted by the Israeli Police on 109 cameras throughout Israel, which showed that the model was more effective in lowering the speed limit and increasing road safety than the existing system. \"This model considers the various system constraints and builds a random enforcement level in accordance with the data. This creates a sense of uncertainty and, as a result, forces the driver to slow down at every point,\" explained Chana Tzur and Danit Arazi, who developed the model. The project advisor is Dr. Irit Novik. As a result of using the new model, the same resources can produce more effective reinforcement, prevent traffic offenders from misleading the enforcement system and thus reduce the level of risk. share in social medias: Previous Update Next Update More Updates Where does Israel go from here?

JCT students develop 3D camera, detects violence against the elderly Home Page News and Updates ... JCT students develop 3D camera, detects violence against the elderly 11.10.2015 3D Camera Detects Violence against the Elderly and Calls for Help Following a year during which severe cases of elderly abuse were reported in the press, a unique development by students of the Jerusalem College of Technology (JCT), in collaboration with GeronTech, seeks to combat the problem. The innovative devise features an advanced three-dimensional camera that sends real-time alerts when detecting that violence is in progress. The technique was developed by Eliya Strasser and Aryeh Striech , students of JCT's Electronic Engineering Department. Unlike the surveillance cameras currently on the market, which document events of violence, the new three-dimensional camera was developed to provide real-time alerts by identifying indications of violence among people in a room utilizing the room's particular depth. By utilizing sophisticated algorithms, the camera identifies the movements of the room's occupants and analyzes them. As soon as the system suspects an act of violence is in progress, it sends an immediate alert to the supervisor. For example, in the event that the camera detects the hand of one of the room's occupants moving abnormally and at a significantly rapid pace, or if the system detects a sound that is abnormally loud that may indicate verbal violence, the system will identify the event as potentially violent and send a notification in real-time. To prevent false alarms, the system will only send alerts of physical violence if it detects rapid movement in the vicinity of another body. In cases where the system detects signs of both physical and verbal abuse, the system classifies the event as high-risk and sends a more urgent immediate alert. In order to avoid intrusion of privacy while still ensuring protection, the video recording cannot be viewed in real-time. Rather, the system operates solely via alerts. It archives recordings and deletes those without alerts. However, when it detects any signs of violence, it saves the footage of the time of the alert and several minutes prior. This means that video footage is viewed only when necessary and can be used subsequently as evidence of foul play. \"In recent years, many videos of abuse of the elderly by their caregivers have been publicized, and public awareness is increasing,\" says Aryeh Striech. He adds: \"When we were contacted by GeronTech, which works to improve the quality of life of elderly people through collaboration with educational institutions for developing technologies for the protection of the elderly, we sought to address their pressing needs and eventually decided to develop this product. We were looking for a solution that would not compromise the privacy of the elderly, as hidden cameras tend to do, but still provide them with the utmost security.\" He also notes that the technology can be adapted for the protection of infants and for any situations involving caregivers.

During their Software Engineering studies, students chose projects and faced unusual challenges. \"Last year we selected a final project from a number of options, one of which was the BI project for the National Insurance Institute,\" said Bouhadana. \"I hadn't been introduced to the subject during my studies and I decided that it was worth studying, but I needed to fill in some gaps.\" As part of a joint initiative between Mia Computers, representative of SAS Israel, and Tal Campus, they met with Michael Klein , Manager of the National Insurance Information Center Unit, who explained the organization's needs. After Mia Computers provided the students with SAS software training, the project got underway. It encompassed the design and implementation of a Business Intelligence (BI) system from the ground up. Bouhadana and Dreyfus followed a specification document and over the past year they developed four areas of BI used by the National Insurance Division. The system handles all the information managed by the Division for Terror Victims. This includes data regarding where the attacks took place, the place of residence of the victims, etc. The new system prevents duplication of information and minimizes the possibility of error. Miri Folk-Rosenbaum , Head of the Division for General Implementations in the National Insurance Institute, stated, \"When Michael Klein presented me with the request from Tal Campus and Mia Computers to integrate students in projects, I saw a wonderful opportunity for the community to contribute to the National Insurance Institute, to encourage immigration and to benefit from it. The project was launched after receiving the blessing of CTO Yehuda Sarussi .\" Klein explained: \"We lacked management information regarding victims of terrorist attacks. Thanks to this project, we now have this vital information. We were able to discover our errors in handling the data and correct them. This subject is very important and we have recently begun using the system in our daily work. In the future it will be integrated into the overall BI system of the National Insurance Institute.\" Folk-Rosenbaum added: \"In light of this successful experience, other departments of the National Insurance Institute have expressed interest in expanding the project and bringing in more students from other fields, utilizing a variety of software tools.\" Eti Stern , Head of Campus Tal, emphasized that \"The integration of students in the National Insurance Institute has greatly contributed to their professional experience, and we hope that it will lead to further cooperation on other projects.\" (Translated from an article that appeared in: http://www.pc.co.il/it-news/183295/) share in social medias: Previous Update Next Update More Updates Where does Israel go from here?

The Weekly Portion - Parshat Bamidbar - Shavuot JCT student Tzvi Silver on Bamidbar and Shavuot 21.5.2015 ENCAMPING WITH HASHEM As we begin Sefer Bemidbar, the subject matter of the pesukim shifts to more technical details-a census of the Jewish people, and how they would divide into different camps when the Shechina would settle from traveling. Before any specifics are mentioned, Hashem tells Moshe and Aharon: אִישׁ עַל דִּגְלוֹ בְאֹתֹת לְבֵית אֲבֹתָם יַחֲנוּ בְּנֵי יִשְׂרָאֵל מִנֶּגֶד סָבִיב לְאֹהֶל מוֹעֵד יַחֲנוּ Each man by his degel, the otot of his father’s house, shall he camp- around the Ohel Moed they will camp. ( במדבר ב:ב ) Rav Avraham Ibn Ezra delves straight into this less than clear description of the rationale of Bnai Yisrael’s camping, by simply answering that the “אות” on each “דגל” was the symbol of each four tribe group, mostly based off of Yaakov’s beracha at the end of Bereshit and a prophecy of Yechezkel (lions, eagles, foxes… almost like in Harry Potter). While Ibn Ezra covers the words in the passuk, he doesn’t explain its deeper meaning. What is the significance of the Jewish People living “על דגלו לבית אבתם.” For a more profound understanding of this passuk , we will look at the deepest, yet most difficult, layer of Torah study: Kabbalah . The Zohar (חלק ג- דף קיח:ב) refers to R’ Elazar who relates to our passuk by immediately quoting one in Yeshayahu: שִׂמְחוּ אֶת יְרוּשָׁלִַם וְגִילוּ בָהּ כָּל אֹהֲבֶיהָ שִׂישׂוּ אִתָּהּ מָשׂוֹשׂ כָּל הַמִּתְאַבְּלִים עָלֶיהָ Be happy, Jerusalem! Rejoice with her, all of her lovers. Be happy with her even with those who mourn her. ( ישיעה סו:י ) The Zohar continues to speak about the importance of being happy in Jerusalem and about her, and how the world is only complete when the Jewish People live in our national capital, without any further mention of our passuk in Bemidar, leaving us to wonder what this whole tangent has to do with the encampment of the Jews in the desert. My chavruta , who has much more experience learning Kabbalah than I do, once told me that when the Zohar brings together ideas that do not seem at all related, it is up to us to figure out the connection. Here is how I believe Yishayahu’s prophecy could explain Am Yisrael’s camping pattern in the wilderness: There are three criteria given in Bemidbar for how the Jews will encamp: “איש על דגלו,” then “באותת,” and finally “לבית אבתם.” It seems clear that the Zohar is interpreting our passuk as referring to the importance of Jews living together (“איש על דגלו”), following Torah and Halacha (“באותת”- the Torah and mitzvot are often referred to as ‘אות היא ביני וביניכם’), and living in the land of our forefathers (“בית אבתם”). Based on this, we can see that this passuk in Bemidbar, which on the surface specifies how the Jews will live in the desert is also hinting to a deeper meaning- how they will live once they enter Eretz Yisrael. According to the Zohar, this is the highest level of living, the true ideal. In essence, the Ba’al HaZohar tried to and succeeded at explaining a very technical and time-specific command to the Jews in Sinai, and managed to make it relevant and full of mussar to nearly every Jew in our times. Skipping a little further in this section of the Zohar, we return to the theme of living in happiness in Jerusalem. A story is brought of R’ Abba who saw a Jewish man celebrating in Babylon and proceeded to confront him and kick him so he would stop dancing. When asked why he did this, R’Abba answered “when Jerusalem is in pain, how can you be celebrating?!” On the other hand, the Ba’al HaZohar teaches that whenever Jews are living in Eretz Yisrael, especially Jerusalem, not only are people happy, but Hashem is also happy. The unity between the joy on Earth and the joy beyond Earth creates something very powerful, similar to the joining of a man and woman when they get married- the greatest type of happiness as two entities who were made for each other finally come together as one. It is very interesting that the Zohar uses this metaphor, as, on Motz’ei Shabbat , we will be celebrating Chag Hashavuot , the holiday which marks the “marriage” of the Jewish People to Hashem with the giving of the Torah. For those who are not familiar with the process of Jewish marriage, Mesechet Kidushin teach that there are three steps to kiddushin : (1) אירוסין, engagement, when a man begins to connect with his fiancée by sanctifying her to him (“הרי את מקודשת לי…”) with an object worth at least a peruta ; then (2) נתינת הטבעת, the giving of the ring by a husband to his wife, the קנין (acquisition) which officially makes these two people one; and finally (3) (כניסה לחופה (לרשות הבעל, the husband bringing his new wife into his home, sealing their marriage. Anyone who is married knows that the months and days preceding a marriage are fun in a surreal and magical way. At the wedding, surrounded by friends, family and loved ones, the feeling of connection and love is beyond words. However, the highest level of love is after the wedding, when the new couple returns home and begins their new life together- this is when the simcha is most real. Chazal famously compare the process of Yetziat Mitzrayim to marriage. When Hashem took our forefathers out of Egypt, He was, so to speak, completing the אירוסין, sanctifying His people. The deal was officially sealed, and we officially joined ourselves to G-d with the receiving of the Torah at Mt. Sinai, a book which, like the wedding ketuva , outlines their obligations to one another. I don’t think it’s a stretch to say that, based on the Zohar, Matan Torah was not really the end of the marriage process wedding the Jewish People to Hashem- there still remained the final step of כניסה לחופה, which Hashem fulfilled with the next generation of Jews by bringing them into Eretz Yisrael, His “רשות.” Only with this final step was our people’s marriage to Hashem sealed, and life could continue on together, in true happiness. On Shavuot, we celebrate the joy as our people became married to Hashem. However, we cannot forget what R’ Abba very forcibly taught in the Zohar. True simcha can only happen when our people are in Eretz Yisrael- only there will the natural and supernatural both celebrate and create something even more powerful together. As we prepare to celebrate Chag HaShavuot , a celebration of our nation’s joining to Hashem, we must stop and ask ourselves; is the journey truly complete? We must remember the lesson that Hashem, based on the Zohar’s interpretation, taught the Jewish People weeks after they first received the Torah- that the ideal way of life, our endgame, is to live “על דגלו באתת לבית אבתם.” Until we have entered Hashem’s Reshut , just as earlier Jews did in the time of Yeshoshua, we have not yet finalized our marriage with Hashem, and we cannot yet celebrate our union with Him, even on Shavuot. Only when Jews live together in Eretz Yisrael can there be the true simcha of our nation’s joining with our Creator, and then, the combined happiness of the heavens and the Earth will surpass even the national high of Ma’amad Har Sinai . With Hashem’s help, we will all merit to enter Hashem’s Reshut and achieve our nation’s true Union with Him, very, very soon.

The Weekly Portion - Parashat Hashavua - Yom Yerushalayim Home Page News and Updates ... The Weekly Portion - Parashat Hashavua - Yom Yerushalayim JCT student Tzvi Silver on Yom Yerushalayim. 14.5.2015 “RELIVING THE BERACHA OF YOM YERUSHALAYIM ” Tzvi Silver, a student in his third year of studies towards a degree in Electronics Engineering at JCT's Lev Campus, with a special D'var Torah for Yom Yerushalayim Forty eight years ago, to the day, the Jewish People were not in a good position. The Egyptian army blocked the Straits of Tiran, a clear act of aggression against Israel, which encouraged her other neighbors to also draw battle lines and prepare for a war to end all wars. While Israel’s greatest allies worked tirelessly to find a diplomatic solution to avoid war, Egypt, Syria, Jordan and Lebanon amassed forces on their borders, getting ready to storm the Jewish State and destroy her for good. Radio broadcasts in Israel and abroad were full of the same grim tidings- cries by Arab leaders for  the Jews to be driven into the Mediterranean Sea, news of fruitless political negotiations, and the especially terrifying declaration by Israeli rabanim that every public park in the country would be a graveyard, in an effort to prepare for the bloody onslaught. At this time Rav Shlomo Goren, chief Rabbi of the IDF, was abroad raising money for the United Jewish Appeal. As news broke of Egypt’s aggression, Rav Goren wanted to return to Israel, but couldn’t make it in time to travel before the weekend, so he spent Shabbat in Far Rockaway, NY, close to the airport. The concerned congregants in the local shul cried out to Rav Goren, asking him how he felt about the situation- about the imminent war, the threats of a second Holocaust, and destruction of the only Jewish State in modern history. Rav Goren, referring to that week’s sedra which is also ours, simply responded: Hashem promised us that no matter how badly we behave, no matter where we are scattered to, He will never destroy us completely. “לא יהיה חורבן שליש,” he cried, “there will not be a third destruction in Jerusalem.” It is very interesting and even scarier that the Six Day War was fought around Shabbat Behukotai. The tochacha , the very scary admonition that makes up the bulk of this sedra , describes the terrible punishments our people face when we, unfortunately, don’t follow G-d’s commands. Broken up into five parts, each corresponding to a progressively worse level of sin, the tochacha serves as a very effective warning to our people of the price of misbehaving. A look into the fifth and most serious tochacha shows that the fears of the Jewish People of 1967 were well founded. G-d, via Moshe, warns us: וְנָתַתִּי אֶת עָרֵיכֶם חָרְבָּה וַהֲשִׁמּוֹתִי אֶת מִקְדְּשֵׁיכֶם וְלֹא אָרִיחַ בְּרֵיחַ נִיחֹחֲכֶם I will make your cities a ruin, I will destroy your temples, and will not accept your service (lit. appreciate the smells of your korbanot ). (ויקרא כו:לא) This sounds exactly like everyone’s worst fears realized- complete destruction of Israeli cities, Jewish religion and culture, while G-d seemingly stands on the side and lets it happen. With this tochacha , the future truly looked too dark to bear. Enter Rav Goren, who optimistically reminded the Jews of Far Rockaway of the final passuk of the tochacha : וְאַף גַּם זֹאת בִּהְיוֹתָם בְּאֶרֶץ אֹיְבֵיהֶם לֹא מְאַסְתִּים וְלֹא גְעַלְתִּים לְכַלֹּתָם לְהָפֵר בְּרִיתִי אִתָּם כִּי אֲנִי ה' אֱלֹקֵיהֶם Even when they are in the land of your enemies, I will not reject them nor destroy them, to stop my covenant with them, for I am Hashem, their G-d. (שם מד) Even at our worst, surrounded by enemies with nowhere else to turn, G-d will never completely destroy our people- we may get hit very badly, and suffer many losses, but at the end of the day, the Jewish People will continue, rebuild, and return. It interesting that the Jewish world of 1967, including the oddly optimistic Rav Goren, related to the Six Day War as a fulfillment of the tochacha . The best case scenario that the Jews of Far Rockaway could imagine was terrible destruction… but not complete annihilation; the promise of continuity. Scarcely a week later, the outcome of the Six Day War exceeded even the wildest dreams of the Jewish People. Not only did we manage to continue- Israel won much more than her people could have ever hoped. Through outright and open miracles (such as Rav Goren accidentally singlehandedly retaking Hebron, the Egyptian Air Force’s mistakes that led to its destruction, and divinely inspired tactics that led to the Syrian army being surrounded on all sides in its own territory… the stories go on and on), our people escaped destruction and ended up retaking the Sinai Peninsula, the Golan Heights, Judea and Samaria, and even our eternal national capital, Jerusalem. No one, not even the Jews at Mt. Sinai, could have foreseen this. In fact, as far as I can tell, Israel’s miraculous victory in the Six Day war has almost nothing in common with the tochacha in Behukotai. Rather, it seems to be a clear fulfillment of the shorter, yet more positive, part of our sedra - the beracha . Chizkuni, in his commentary on the passuk “ונתתי את עריכם חרבה,” notes the contrast between this verse and corresponding points in the beracha . “ערים חרבה, our cities destroyed ” is directly opposite “וְרָדְפוּ מִכֶּם חֲמִשָּׁה מֵאָה וּמֵאָה מִכֶּם רְבָבָה יִרְדֹּפוּ וְנָפְלוּ אֹיְבֵיכֶם לִפְנֵיכֶם לֶחָרֶב- and five of you will chase a hundred [of your enemies], and one hundred will chase ten thousand, and your enemies will fall to the sword ” (כו:ח). The next phrase “והשימותי את מקדשיכם,” is a punishment opposite “וְנָתַתִּי מִשְׁכָּנִי בְּתוֹכֲכֶם וְלֹא תִגְעַל נַפְשִׁי אֶתְכֶם- I will place My dwelling among you, and My soul  I will not be disgusted by you ” (יא). Lastly, “ולא אריח בריח ניחחכם” corresponds to “יְהִתְהַלַּכְתִּי בְּתוֹכֲכֶם וְהָיִיתִי לָכֶם לֵאלֹהִים וְאַתֶּם תִּהְיוּ לִי לְעָם- And I will walk among you, be for you a G-d, and you will be for me a nation .” (יב) It is my belief that Chizkuni’s analysis here perfectly describes the “before” and “after” of the Six Day War, albeit for good. Jews of 1967 expected “ערים חרבה,” rampant destruction in their land. Instead, by G-d’s Grace, we merited a disproportionate victory, where, in some cases, five soldiers truly won battles against armies at least one hundred times bigger than them. The IDF’s success, as an army of scarcely 250,000 troops against a collective 550,000 aggressors, truly seems to fulfill “ומאה מכם רבבה ירדפו,” and we are truly fortunate that our casualties, while painful, were less than one thousand, while our enemies suffered at least 25,000 losses of soldiers, and over 450 aircraft- this very clearly seems to be “ונפלו איביכם לפניכם לחרב.” Jews of 1967 expected “והשימותי את מקדשיכם,” removal from the Holy Land and a destruction of the Jewish religion in Israel and beyond. However, we ended up with “ונתתי משכני בתוככם,”winning back the holiest place in the world, where Avraham almost sacrificed his son, where two Temples once stood and a third one will again stand. Our forebears thought that G-d was ignoring their tefilot for mercy (“ולא אריח בריח ניחחכם”). In the end, the Jewish people merited the opposite- G-d walked directly among them, personally fighting their battles and ensuring their success (“והתהלכתי בתוככם והייתי לכם לאלקים”). With this understanding, we must now ask ‘why.’ All of the Jews of 1967 were expecting destruction, terrible losses, and a fulfillment of the worst tochacha . How did we instead merit what seems to be a fulfillment of the beracha ? At the end of the tochacha , G-d elaborates on the main sin which leads to an enactment of this admonishment: ...בְּמַעֲלָם אֲשֶׁר מָעֲלוּ בִי וְאַף אֲשֶׁר הָלְכוּ עִמִּי בְּקֶרִי … In their transgressions against me, and even walking with me in keri. (כו:מ) Most commentators interpret “קרי” as casualness- they say that the Jewish people’s greatest sin, which can lead to the most terrible punishment against them, is not realizing the significance in G-d’s actions. When one thinks back, or looks at recent events, and doesn’t properly see Hashem’s hand in them, he is violating this very serious transgression. In order to correctly serve G-d and avoid being punished with the tochacha , we have a responsibility to seek out G-d’s hand in our lives, to ensure that we do not relate to Hashem in casualness, “קרי.” Based on this, I would like to answer that the Jewish People of 1967 didn’t end up receiving the terrible punishments that they had anticipated, because they didn’t relate to their Creator “בקרי.” It’s clear from the stories that have emerged from  the weeks preceding the Six Day War, such as the one of Rav Goren which we saw earlier, that all Jews were concerned about the plight of their brothers in Israel. When events began to unfold, the Jews of Israel and the Exile united, seeing Hashem’s hand as the situation became progressively worse, and came together to pray for His help. Since they all, as one, recognized G-d’s hand in the upcoming battle, they merited an amazing victory and a complete 180-turn from tochacha to beracha . Jumping forty eight years later, we truly need to learn from the actions of the holy Jews of 1967. Recent tragedies over the past few months have given our people opportunities to reunite, albeit for very unfortunate reasons. We’ve even been able to see G-d’s hand in some of these tragedies, as, for instance, the untimely deaths of Eyal, Naftali and Gilad gave the IDF an opportunity to stop a terrible plot by Hamas to infiltrate and wreak a bloody attack on Israel during Rosh Hashana. However, as we approach Yom Yerushalayim, the day of amazing miracles for the Jewish People, it is not enough to just see Hashem’s hand in recent events. We must also ensure that we are not relating to Him “בקרי,” casually- we must seek out His presence, in order to also merit a complete reversal from the tochacha that recent events appear to be leading to, to beracha , and salvation. How do we accomplish this? By embracing the geu’lah , and moving home to Eretz Yisrael, to where Hashem’s shechina is constantly present and miracles happen every day, whether we see them or not. One who continues their lives in the Exile, despite recent and less recent miracles, shows that they are ignoring  the message G-d’s actions , relating to him on the worst levels of “ קרי .” This is exactly what the tochacha of Parshat Behukotai warns us about. The worst punishments come to am Yisrael not when they forget about G-d, but when they do recognize His hand and nonetheless decide to ignore it. With recent news of Anti-Semitism, Iran’s nuclear program, Global Jihad and ISIL, and violence in the USA, Europe, and the rest of the world, one could very much jump to the same conclusions that even the most optimistic Jews of 1967 made- we are heading for a tochacha . We could begin to look at the positives parts of the tochacha : We may have lost millions of Jews over the past century, but at least we keep on going, and G-d will never break His covenant with our ancestors, to ensure the survival of our nation. However, I believe that instead of hoping for a lesser tochacha , we should seek out the beracha . We must proactively seek out Hashem’s hand in our lives and the fate of our people, and stop treating his will with the casualness that many of am Yisrael have been suffering from for over 67 years. If we are to have any hope of turning frightening world events into a victory, one beyond even the miraculous events of Yom Yerushalayim, we must, as a people, stop relating to Hashem “בקרי” and return home once and for all. Only through this can we ever hope to turn the terrible tochacha of painful life in the Exile into the eternal beracha of the redemption.

Torah and Science: Better Together JCT alum and Friends of the JCT board member, Abbe Dienstag, on the importance of combining Torah and Science at JCT. 20.11.2014 Torah and Science: Better Together \"One of my fondest memories from my early days studying at the Jerusalem College of Technology (JCT) in the early 1970s were the Friday night sessions with Professor Yehuda (Leo) Levi at his home in the Bayit Vegan neighborhood of Jerusalem. Though JCT now boasts a sizeable institution with three campuses and thousands of students, back when I was a student, there were no more than 40 of us studying in a small, converted apartment building. After the Friday night meal, we would trek over to Professor Levi’s home, and gather around his dining room table in the dim but warm glow of a generator driven lamp to discuss Torah and science. Professor Levi was the head of the nascent electro-optics department at the College.  In addition to various scientific publications, he had by then also authored a slender volume called Vistas from Mount Moriah: A Scientist Views Judaism and the World (1959), in which he presented a philosophy of science from the perspective of a Torah observant Jew.  He went on to publish additional, more extensive works on the subject, but this book was our text.  And the starting point of our discussions was a statement in the Babylonian Talmud (Shabbat 75a), in which the rabbis derived the obligation for calculating seasonal cycles and planetary courses from the passage in Deuteronomy (4:6), “For this is your wisdom and understanding in the sight of the nations.”\" Click here to read the full blog post at The Times of Israel share in social medias: Previous Update Next Update More Updates Where does Israel go from here?

JCT Launches \"Yazam BaLev\" Accelerator Program Home Page News and Updates ... JCT Launches \"Yazam BaLev\" Accelerator Program First hi-tech Haredi accelerator program opens at JCT 19.11.2014 \"Even Avraham – the first Jewish entrepreneur – didn't receive the support he deserved\" Hundreds of Haredim participated in an introductory conference – the first of its kind - for training of religious hi-tech entrepreneurs. Stuart Hershkowitz, who established the program, states: \"we will provide every participant with the help they need to achieve an exit.\" Hundreds of Haredim participated in \"Yazam BaLev\", an introductory conference – the first of its kind - for training of religious hi-tech entrepreneurs, which was held last Thursday at the Jerusalem College of Technology – Lev Academic Center (JCT). This accelerator program will provide support and training for participants, in order to assist them in realizing their ventures. As of the event, some twenty ventures had been presented, and ten have already applied to the program. As part of the program, entrepreneurs who are accepted into the program will undergo an intensive training program for 14 weeks, preparing them to present before investors and attempt to raise investments for establishing a start-up company. As of now, the program staff is in the process of selecting ventures for the program, favoring applicants with the highest potential for success. During the event, Ben Wiener, mentor of the program and manager of venture capital \"Jumpspeed Ventures,\" presented the training curriculum and explained the ideal guiding the entrepreneurs. \"Avraham was essentially the first Jewish entrepreneur. He left everything familiar and went after what he believed in, despite the fact that he received no support from those around him,\" explained Wiener. \"We want to take on people who believe in what they're doing, and who want to actualize their potential.\" \"We are proud to be the first academic institution to assist Haredi entrepreneurs, continuing our tradition of excellence in the hi-tech field,\" says Stuart Hershkowitz, Senior Advisor to the President of JCT and initiator of the Accelerator program. \"There are hundreds of entrepreneurs with immense potential in the religious and Haredi sectors, there are innovative ideas and all they need is a chance to grow, we are doing everything in our power in order to enable each participant to achieve an exit in the best possible way.\" Jonathan Caras, a graduate of JCT who developed a venture of his own – a video texting app, which later became the company \"Glide\" spoke at the conference. He detailed the steps he took to reach where he is today and explained how one can take an idea and develop it into a start-up. \"It takes a great deal of investment and effort, but if you believe in yourself, you can go far,\" said Caras. This is a unique Accelerator program, optimized for the Haredi sector, which will provide entrepreneurs with the tools they need to develop their ideas into start-ups.

The constitutive tensor encompasses 36 permittivity/permeability functions characterizing the electromagnetic properties of the vacuum. These 36 functions can be grouped into 20+15+1 functions. Thereof, 20 functions finally yield a dilaton field and the metric of spacetime, 1 function represents the axion field, and 15 functions the (traceless) skewon field S. In this lecture, we discuss some of the properties of the skewon field, such as its electromagnetic energy density, its possible coupling to Einstein-Cartan gravity, and its corresponding gravitational energy.

A 347 (2005) 14-24 Shlomo Engelberg , JCT, Israel (joint work with Eitan Tadmor of the University of Maryland and Hailiang Liu of Iowa State University) Title: Critical Thresholds in Euler-Poisson Equations Abstract: In this talk, we discuss the finite-time breakdown of solutions in various forms of the Euler-Poisson equations.  We show that this breakdown occurs only when the initial conditions cross a critical threshold .  This type of behavior is most easily observed in the Burgers' equation: \\begin{displaymath} u_t + u u_x =0. \\end{displaymath} It is well known that the solutions of this equation break down in finite time unless $u_x(x,0) > 0$ for all $x$.  We show that in a variety of cases, a similar critical thresholds exists. Alberto Favaro , Oldenburg University, Germany Title:  Electromagnetic Media with Two Light Cones Abstract:  Electromagnetic media such that the Fresnel surface, governing wave propagation, is the union of two distinct light cones, play a role both in materials science and in spacetime physics. In the former discipline, the crystals endowed with this property are well-studied, as the double cone geometry corresponds to a simple type of birefringence. In the latter context, the nonlinear model of vacuum by Heisenberg and Euler, as well as the general theory due to Plebanski, yield a Fresnel surface, whose significance must be restricted to high-frequency electromagnetic waves, that is the union of two distinct light cones [1]. Not every pair of Lorentzian metrics can arise via the double cone geometry. For instance, there exists no local and linear medium such that the Fresnel surface includes the metrics g1=diag(-1,1,1,1) and g2=diag(-1,2,2,2).  We determine the necessary and sufficient conditions for two Lorentzian metrics to proceed from a local and linear medium. Our requirements are very similar to the algebraic Rainich conditions, which lie at the heart of the “already unified field theory” for gravity and electrodynamics [2]. The findings are applied to Chromium Sesquioxide cr2o3, whose Fresnel surface is demon-strated to be the union of two light cones. Two novel 4-dimensional scalars M 12 and M 21  are extracted from the optical metrics of this crystal. We calculate M 12 and M 21 at a temperature of 298.65K from experimental data. The axion field, another spacetime scalar of Chromium Sesquioxide, was measured in 2008 [3]. References [1] Y. Obukhov and G. Rubilar.

Yaakov Friedman , JCT, Israel (joint work with Ezra Yudkin) Title: Pulse Propagation in Single Resonant Media and Time Spectrum Abstract:  We obtain a new formula for the time spectrum of a single resonant media. We show that the fundamental equations for electromagnetic pulse propagation in a single resonant media, described by Burnham and R. Y. Chiao, have an additional solution to the one described there which is used for the calculation of time spectra. Such time spectra are a basic tool in Mossbauer spectroscopy based on synchrotron radiation. We show that the improved solution fits the experimental data from NFS spectra obtained at PETRA III.

David Hai Gootvilig , JCT, Israel (joint work with Yaakov Friedman) Title: Self-dual electromagnetic tensor and the pre-potential Abstract: We define the Hodge dual operator on the standard representation of the Lie algebra of the Lorentz group on Minkowski space. For any EM field tensor, we associate a self-dual tensor. We show that outside of the sources of the field, a self-dual 4-potential can be defined. For an arbitrary observer, we find a constant, depending only on the null-displacement between the observer and the source of the field, which is invariant under the self-dual representation of the Lorentz group. This invariant is used to define the pre-potential of the EM field. We show that the pre-potential of a point charge in arbitrary motion produces the correct field and that outside of the sources, the pre-potential is always self-dual. Maxwell's equations for the pre-potential are derived.  The gauge freedom of the pre-potential is described. We find conditions on the current density for the existence of a pre-potential. Examples for the relation between the pre-potential, the 4-current and the field are presented in the following cases: a charged infinite rod, a charged infinite plate, and the current through an infinite solenoid. Eduardo Guendelman , Ben Gurion University, Israel Title: Scalar gauge fields. Abstract:  In this talk, we give a variation of the gauge procedure which employs a scalar gauge field, B(x), in addition to the usual vector gauge field Au(x). We study this variation of the usual gauge procedure in the context of a complex scalar matter field 0(x) with a U(1) symmetry. We will focus primarily on the case when 0(x) develops a vacuum expectation value via spontaneous symmetry breaking. We find that under these conditions, the scalar gauge field mixes with the Goldstone boson that arises from the breaking of a global symmetry. Some other interesting features of this scalar gauge model are: (i) The new gauge procedure gives rise to terms which violate C and CP symmetries. This may have applications in cosmology or for CP violation in particle physics; (ii) the existence of mass terms in the Lagrangian which respect the new extended gauge symmetry. Thus, one can have gauge field mass terms even in the absence of the usual Higgs mechanism; (iii) the emergence of a sine-Gordon potential for the scalar gauge field; (iv) a natural, axion-like suppression of the interaction strength of the scalar gauge boson.

Here we discuss the question whether and how this gravitomagnetic field can also be measured using clocks on orbiting satellites. Two clocks on counter-rotating equatorial circular orbits around the Earth show a difference of about s per revolution. However, the measurability of this effect depends on the accuracy and stability of the clocks used as well as on the precise knowledge of the satellites orbits. It is shown that with present technology, it is possible in principle to measure this gravitomagnetic clock effect with satellites on arbitrary orbits. In particular, we analyze whether the gravitomagnetic clock effect has an impact on the clocks on the Galileo satellites. Such a measurement would constitute another important Solar System test of Einstein's General Relativity. E. Hackmann and C. Laemmerzahl: A generalized gravitomagnetic clock effect, arXiv:1406.6232 [gr-qc]. Martin Land , Hadassah College, Israel Title:  Pair production in classical electrodynamics Abstract:  We calculate pair production from bremsstrahlung as a classical effect in Stueckelberg electrodynamics.  In this framework, O(3,1)-covariant events parameterized by a Poincare-invariant chronological time evolve in an unconstrained 8D phase space, and interact through five gauge fields defined on spacetime and the independent chronological time.  We consider a three-stage interaction which according to the laboratory clock appears as (1) the scattering of particle-1 with a heavy nucleus to produce bremsstrahlung, (2) the creation of a particle/antiparticle pair from the radiation component of the bremsstrahlung, (3) annihilation of the antiparticle with particle-2 in the presence of a second heavy nucleus.  When parameterized in chronological time, the underlying process develops as (1) the scattering of particle-2 from the second nucleus to backward time evolution with negative energy, (2) the scattering of particle-1 from the first nucleus and release of bremsstrahlung, (3) absorption of bremsstrahlung radiation by particle-2 which returns to forward time evolution with positive energy. Volker Perlick , ZARM, University of Bremen, Germany Uziel Sandler , JCT, Israel Title:  Lagrangian Fuzzy Dynamics of Physical and Non-Physical Systems Abstract:  In this talk, we show how to study the evolution of a system, given imprecise knowledge about the state of the system and the dynamics laws.  Our approach is based on Fuzzy Set Theory, and it will be shown that the Fuzzy Dynamics of an n-dimensional system is equivalent to Lagrangian (or Hamiltonian) mechanics in an n+1-dimensional space. In some cases, however, the corresponding Lagrangian is more general than the usual one and could depend on the action. In this case, Lagrange's equations gain a non-zero right-hand side proportional to the derivative of the Lagrangian with respect to the action.  Examples of such systems are unstable systems, systems with dissipation and systems which can remember their history. Moreover, in certain situations, the Lagrangian could be a set-valued function. The corresponding equations of motion then become differential inclusions instead of differential equations.  We will also show that the principal of least action is a consequence of the causality principle and the local topology of the state space and not an independent axiom of classical mechanics. We emphasize that our adaptation of Lagrangian mechanics does not use or depend on specific properties of the physical system being modeled. Therefore, this Lagrangian approach may be equally applied to non-physical systems. An example of such an application is presented as well. Tzvi Scarr , JCT, Israel (joint work with Yaakov Friedman) Title: Relativistic Transformation for the Radius of a Rotating Disk Abstract:  Based on the symmetries of a rotating system, we derive the general form of the relativistic spacetime transformations from a rotating system to an inertial one.  The explicit form of these transformations is derived rigorously, using only the basic tenets of Special Relativity and the methods of covariant uniform acceleration . There are no arbitrary assumptions, as in all previous theories. We show that the speed, with respect to an inertial frame, of a rest point in a rotating system of any size does not exceed the speed of light. This implies that special relativity does not impose a limitation on the size of a rotating object. We obtain global relativistic rotations. The horizon problem does not arise. We show how to synchronize clocks on a rotating disk, avoiding the time gap . Roee Steiner , Ben Gurion University, Israel Title: Dynamical Couplings in Gauge Theories and Relation to Confinement Mechanisms Abstract: By using a variation of the gauge procedure which employs a scalar gauge field, B(x), in addition to the usual vector gauge field Au(x), we can couple abelian gauge fields to currents which allow dynamical coupling constants, which could depend, for example, on the local value of a scalar field. In the simplest realization of these models, such theories naturally lead to a confinement of charge inside bags, where the charge current is confined inside Bags via MIT Bag model boundary conditions. Other formulations allow the possibility of gauge invariant formulation of dynamical couplings, for example, time-dependent fine structure constant, without associated confinement mechanisms. Ezra Yudkin , JCT, Israel (joint work with Yaakov Friedman) Title: Testing Einstein's time dilation and clock hypothesis Abstract: Einstein's time dilation may be tested by the Transverse Doppler shift. Similarly, the Clock Hypothesis can be tested by a Doppler shift due to acceleration. Mossbauer spectroscopy with a rotating absorber can be used to test such shifts. We explain the need of a Synchrotron Mossbauer Source for such an experiment. We present the results of the HC-1361 experiment performed at ESRF to study the Mossbauer spectra of a rotating absorber, and propose a method to test properly Einstein's time dilation and clock hypothesis. share in social medias: Previous Update Next Update More Updates Where does Israel go from here?

Parashat Hashavua -The Weekly Portion - Rosh Hashana Home Page News and Updates ... Parashat Hashavua -The Weekly Portion - Rosh Hashana JCT student Tzvi Silver on this week's parasha. 23.9.2014 ROSH HASHANA: THE POWER OF JUDGEMENT Tzvi Silver, a student in his third year of studies towards a degree in Electronics Engineering at JCT's Lev Campus, on this week's parasha When it comes to the Jewish Holidays that scatter our national calendar, there is often confusion about the true nature of the celebration. I believe that Rosh Hashana is quite possibly the most misunderstood holiday of the year- spanning the first two days of the New Year, and called יום הדין, יום הזיכרון and יום תרועה, Rosh Hashana's true nature is quite mysterious. The symbolism is clear- judging of fates, blowing the shofar as a reminder for all to repent, dipping the apple in the honey to symbolize a sweet new year- it's all there. But what is the deeper meaning of the holiday that we will be celebrating on Wednesday night? I find that a lot can be learned about the essence of a chag from the scriptural readings that Chazal assigned for that day. For Rosh Hashana, there are two distinct themes for the two days. On the first day, we read of two desperate tefilot being miraculously fulfilled, both for children from a woman who never believed she would have any- in the Torah reading, we read of the joy that Avraham and Sarah have on the birth of our forefather Yitzchak, and the Haftara features the moving story of Chana's birth of Shmuel Hanavi and her subsequent song of praise. The underlying theme on the first day of Rosh Hashana is clearly the potential of Tefilot being answered. However, the second day's message is a little bit less clear. From the Torah, we continue the story of Yitzchak, of the terrible challenge that Avraham faces having to sacrifice his son and the miraculous last minute salvation from this deed. Then, we read from the thirty first perek of Yirmiyahu, but this time there is no happy ending, only hope for the future as we read of our own plight. The Jewish People were exiled for their sins, but one day there will be salvation, Hashem tells Yirmiyahu. Rachel calls out for children to return, and G-d reassures her that they will soon return from their enemy's land, fulfilling His promise to Avraham of \"וירש זרעך את שער איביו.\" The reading ends on a high note: \"רחם ארחמנו נאם ה'- I will surely take pity on them, the words of Hashem.\" It emerges that the theme of the Second Day of Rosh Hashana is of tests- Avraham is tested after his tefilot are tested, and the Jews in the exile are being tested in order for their tefilot to be answered. If we take a step back and look at the bigger picture, it becomes clear that theme of Rosh Hashana, at least based on the readings from scripture, is judgment, יום הדין. On the first day, we read of G-d's judgment, His merciful decision to answer Sarah and Chana's tefilot, and on the second day, we read of our judgment, the decisions and reactions to challenges and tests that allow us to earn merciful judgment, whether before the actual bracha is given or after. This message is extremely important in our times. We live in a world of many challenges, of Hamas, ISIS, Anti-Semitism, and Religious issues (חילול השם, intermarriage), and Rosh Hashana is the time for us to beseech G-d for a safe and healthy new year. The sky is the limit in terms of how our salvation will arrive, and all we need to do is take יום הדין seriously and make our case before G-d just as Avraham and Sarah and Chana did. Even now, on Erev Rosh Hashana, it's clear that our ישועה has already begun. Hashem, in His ultimate mercy, has judged us favorably and granted us a safe haven in which to serve Him without fear from our enemies, a beginning of the redemption. But, our beracha is not complete yet, and we cannot earn the full גאולה without exercising our judgment against the test that G-d has given us. Like Avraham, we are asked to make a sacrifice, but ours is a lot less scary: Do תשובה, heed the call and return home to Eretz Yisrael. If we can use our judgment to pass this test, then, with Hashem's help, we will merit the promise at the end of the Haftara of \"רחם ארחמנו נאם ה'- I will surely take pity on them, the words of Hashem.\" share in social medias: Previous Update Next Update More Updates Where does Israel go from here?

Parashat Hashavua - The Weekly Portion - Nitzvaim/Vayelech Home Page News and Updates ... Parashat Hashavua - The Weekly Portion - Nitzvaim/Vayelech JCT student Tzvi Silver on this week's parasha. 18.9.2014 THE FINAL TESHUVA Tzvi Silver, a student in his third year of studies towards a degree in Electronics Engineering at JCT's Lev Campus, on this week's parasha After presenting the intense bracha and klala of last week's sedra , of the threat of eternal exile if we stray from the mitzvot , Moshe Rabeinu speaks of the final teshuva that will end the exile: וְשַׁבְתָּ עַד-ה' אֱלֹקֶיךָ, וְשָׁמַעְתָּ בְקֹלוֹ, And you shall return unto Hashem your G-d, and you shall listen to His voice (דברים ל:ב) Next, Moshe tells Am Yisrael of the result of their teshuva , the ingathering of the exiles that will signal the geulah : וֶהֱבִיאֲךָ ה' אֱלֹקֶיךָ, אֶל-הָאָרֶץ אֲשֶׁר-יָרְשׁוּ אֲבֹתֶיךָ--וִירִשְׁתָּהּ; וְהֵיטִבְךָ וְהִרְבְּךָ, מֵאֲבֹתֶיךָ. And Hashem your G-d will bring you into the land that your forefathers inherited and you will inherit it, and He will be good to you and multiply you above your forefathers (שם ה) After further explaining the greatness of this time of redemption, we, the readers, are left wondering what could possibly come next. Instead of describing אחרית הימים, or עולם הבא, or a logical next step to this narrative, we are instead presented with a very upbeat and encouraging description: כִּי הַמִּצְוָה הַזֹּאת, אֲשֶׁר אָנֹכִי מְצַוְּךָ הַיּוֹם--לֹא-נִפְלֵאת הִוא מִמְּךָ, וְלֹא רְחֹקָה הִוא. For this commandment which I command you this day, it is not too hard for you, nor is it far off . (שם יא) What is this very doable and even more important mitzva ? Neither you nor I can easily know, as the pesukim do not explicitly elaborate on what is going on here. This leaves us wondering; what exactly is this mitzva we are being commanded today? The commentators attempt to untangle this by filling in the blanks in this vague four- passuk section. Most of the commentators, headed by Rashi, explain that this mitzva is the commandment to learn Torah. Learning Torah can be very daunting, especially when one is coming from a weak background, and it can often seem unreachable. But, as the following pesukim read, \"it is not in the heaven… it is not beyond the sea,\" rather, \"it is close to you, in your mouth and your heart to do it.\" The commandment to learn Torah could very well fit the bill for this ambiguous mitzva - studying it can ensure that we do not sin and return to the exile that the previous pesukim described our leaving. However, when I initially read these four pesukim , I thought of something completely different. Later research showed me that it could be a correct interpretation, based on a minority of the commentators. Whether it is or isn't this mystery mitzva , there is an important lesson to be learned from my idea. Allow me to elaborate… On דברים ל:יא, one commentator stands out with a different interpretation of \"המצוה הזאת.\" Rav Ovadia ben Yaakov Sforno answers that the mitzva is none other than the all-important commandment to do תשובה. You may ask; most of the first half of דברים ל discussed תשובה- why is brought here as a different, difficult commandment. Sforno answers: כי המצוה הזאת. והטעם שאמרתי והשבות אל לבבך בכל הגוים שצריך שהתשובה תהיה בעודך בגלות למען תושע הוא כי אמנם זאת המצוה של תשובה אשר אנכי מצוך היום ... For this commandment . And the reason that it was [already] written \"and you shall return to your heart\"… because this teshuva must be done while still in the exile, in order to merit that He (G-d) will save you, and this is the commandment of teshuva that \"I command you today\"… (ספורנו שם) Sforno writes that this commandment of teshuva is not your run of the mill variety of repentance, for the pesukim already spoke of this spiritual atonement and return previously. Now, these pesukim are speaking about a \"special\" kind of teshuva , an active type which must be done in the exile in order to merit returning to Eretz Yisrael. To my knowledge, there is only one such kind of teshuva - yearning to return to Eretz Yisrael , living our lives with the desire to come home, and, ultimately, making the difficult journey to complete our teshuva . Close your eyes and imagine a world where a Jewish national teshuva campaign succeeded, and led to an opportunity for our people to return home for the first time in millennia. Imagine that the Land of Israel was wide open, waiting for her exiles to return, and she had blessed with riches and wealth. This is an amazing opportunity, but also a very scary one. Returning home would require a long trip, leaving everything familiar behind, and starting life all over again, which is quite the daunting task. In light of this fearful decision, the natural step after the \"opening\" of kibbutz galiyot outlined at the beginning of דברים ל', Moshe gives encouraging words to the future Jews who will be preparing to do this difficult teshuva . \"This mitzva is not too hard, and not too far off. It is not in the heavens, nor is it beyond the sea. It is close to you, and it can be done.\" Now open your eyes. We are the generation of Jews faced with this challenge. In the last sixty six years, our homeland has been given back to us and has been blessed in ways that our forebears Avraham, Yitzchak, Yaakov, and Moshe could only have dreamed of seeing in their respective times. The process of קיבוץ גליות is well under way, and most of world Jewry have relocated home. But, now it is about you, the individual facing the challenge of undertaking a difficult teshuva that our grandparents could only have dreamed of being able to do. The path going forward is not easy, it may not be \"in the heavens,\" and it is truly \"beyond the sea\" (no pun intended). But, this cannot stop us from embracing our national destiny. (In case we need any more proof that this message is directed to us, it is interesting to note that the gematria of שמעבר לימה is 697, approximately equal to אמריקה שלי- an especially relevant proof for those gematria /Torah codes buffs) In the seventeenth perek of Orot HaTeshuva , Rav Kook writes about this exact type of teshuva . He speaks of the importance of the tikun of returning home as a priority on both a national and personal level, as the Torah very clearly commands us \"ושבת עד ה' אלקיך\" and \"כי תשוב אל ה' אלקיך.\" My rebbe , Rav Menachem Akerman interprets this double wording as both a promise and a commandment; You will merit to return to Eretz Yisrael , only if you fulfill the mitzva of teshuva and work hard to make the move home. In our days, aliyah has become a national priority, but it cannot fully succeed and teshuva cannot be fully completed until each and every one of us makes it a personal priority as well. We now find ourselves less than a week from יום הדין, the Judgment Day. In two weeks, our fates for the next year will be sealed. This is the time for תשובה, especially the \"special\" type encouraged by Moshe in דברים ל. We must enter 5775 with this teshuva as a personal priority. Otherwise, how can we ever hope to merit to be sealed in ספר החיים if we continue to avoid ארץ החיים?! In this time of תושבה, we cannot ignore Hoshea's call of \"שובה ישראל עד ה' אלקיך.\" With Hashem's help, may we all be sealed in the Book of Life in the merit of our teshuva , heeding Moshe Rabeinu's call to return home to Eretz Yisrael . share in social medias: Previous Update Next Update More Updates Where does Israel go from here?

Parashat Hashavua - The Weekly Portion - Ki Tavo Home Page News and Updates ... Parashat Hashavua - The Weekly Portion - Ki Tavo JCT student Tzvi Silver on this week's parasha. 11.9.2014 ARAMI OVED AVI : BALANCING GRATITUDE AND APPRECIATION Tzvi Silver, a student in his third year of studies towards a degree in Electronics Engineering at JCT's Lev Campus, on this week's parasha Moshe's inspired monologue continues into our sedra and broaches an important aspect of living in Israel: gratitude. When the first fruit of the שבעת המינים are harvested, they are presented to G-d at the בית המקש in thankfulness. But this appreciation is for more than the abundant plenty of produce- the one who brings ביכורים recites a moving passage at the Temple, reminding all present of how amazing it is that he even had a field to plant crops in the first place, because, as he says: וְעָנִיתָ וְאָמַרְתָּ לִפְנֵי ה' אֱלֹקֶיךָ, אֲרַמִּי אֹבֵד אָבִי, וַיֵּרֶד מִצְרַיְמָה, וַיָּגָר שָׁם בִּמְתֵי מְעָט; וַיְהִי-שָׁם, לְגוֹי גָּדוֹל עָצוּם וָרָב. And he shall answer and respond before Hashem your G-d: Arami Oved Avi , and he descended to Egypt and lived there in poverty, but he became there a great and intense nation . (דברים כו:ה) The reading continues with a rendition of the Egyptian Exodus, concluding: וַיְבִאֵנוּ, אֶל-הַמָּקוֹם הַזֶּה; וַיִּתֶּן-לָנוּ אֶת-הָאָרֶץ הַזֹּאת, אֶרֶץ זָבַת חָלָב וּדְבָשׁ. And He brought us to this place, and He gave us this land, one which flows with milk and honey . (שם ט) The contrast between our nation's low beginning, ארמי אבד אבי, and where the landowner is now, bringing his fruit in Jerusalem, is a humbling reminder of all of the good that Hashem has done to him and the Jewish People. The first three words of this reading are perhaps the most confusing yet meaningful words of the entire section, describing our truly humble beginnings. Ibn Ezra explains that they refer to Yaakov's poverty in his initial exile- our forefather was, literally, a wandering Aramean, without a penny to his name. Now, a few generations later, his descendants are so prosperous that not only do we have land, and produce- we even have enough surplus that we can give back to our G-d who gave us these riches. Rashi, taking a less literal approach, famously explains these words as: an Aramean (Laban) tried to destroy our forefather Yaakov. While its not very clear exactly how Laban tried to destroy Yaakov, their relationship was far from pleasant, and our forefather was definitely persecuted by his father-in-law. Jumping forward to the bringing of the ביכורים, many generations and \"Laban\"s later, it is quite remarkable that not only had we survived persecution, but we've entered our own land, and are prosperous there. With this perspective, the ביכורים ceremony is quite miraculous. Whether remembering previous poverty or persecution, at the time of immense celebration, of presenting the first produce of the seven holy species, it is very important to remember our humble beginings. We could have been destroyed, we could have starved, we should have been subjected to eternal slavery in Egypt. Yet, with G-d's help, we survived to tell the tale, and even inherited our own land and merited to prosper there. We must remember this, to avoid the consequences of the warnings of Sefer Devarim, that if we forget our miraculous roots, we will begin to think \"כוחי ועוצם ידי עשה את החיל הזה\"- no time is more susceptible to this than the presentation of a farmer's hard work, which he toiled over for months. At the climax of his hard work, he must remember the One who ensured his survival and aided in every step of the farming. The public nature of this recitation also reaches out to those who are watching, reminding them of the source of the beautiful produce and the miracle of their existence. This lesson is equally applicable in our times, even in the temporary absence of the בית המקדש. More than half of world Jewry lives in the Holy Land, and almost 10,000 Jews have moved this year alone to Eretz Yisrael. The Jewish State of Israel and all it has accomplished should be a source of pride for all of us, whether we live there yet or not, and we luckily have many opportunities to celebrate this pride (the spring season of \"the Yom's\"). But, at the emotional highs of these celebrations, we, like the bringer of ביכורים, must remember \"ארמי אבד אבי.\" Less than a hundred years ago, our ancestors were facing poverty and persecution in Europe and Africa. We cannot forget the six million brothers (hy\"d) who lost their lives because of their nationality, by the hands of the latest \"ארמי.\" These losses must permeate all of our celebrations, to remind us of the price of freedom and drive home how fortunate we are to have merited the end of the passage, \"ויבאנו אל המקום הזה.\" On the other hand, it behooves us not to go too far to the other extreme. Two thousand years of persecution and poverty have caused religious Judaism to understandably be insular and defensive, never trusting a gentile nation or government for fear of repercussions. However, for the 6 million plus Jews currently living in Israel, this is no longer a problem. \"ארמי אבד אבי\" has finally given way for \"ויבאנו אל המקום הזה,\" and while we may still have enemies abroad, we no longer need to remain separate from our government, because… drumroll… we are the government. Nonetheless, sixty six and a half years have not been enough time for the more Haredi sects of Judaism to shed this suspicion and embrace their brothers in the Jewish Israeli government. One need look no further than last week's news to see proof of this dangerous \" Arami Oved Avi \" complex. In preperation for the September 1st beginning of school in Ramat Bet Shemesh, a group of Haredi activists, led by their questionably elected mayor, occupied part of an underused secular school for their overcrowded Bais Yaakov seminary. While I will not get into whether these actions were justified or not (my longtime readers should not have very much doubt how I feel), one could ask why they didn't first contact the proper authorities in the Education Ministry before taking these unilateral actions. However, based on the lesson above, it's very clear that these activists are truly stuck in \" Arami Oved Avi \" complex- they are convinced that the Israeli government is persecuting them, so instead of trying to speak to their sympathetic brothers there, they took illegal action to ensure their way. They still think in the insular, separatist \"shtetl\" mentality, and are victimizing themselves in the process. These activists need to remember that there is reason to celebrate- we've merited a final \"ויבאנו אל המקום הזה,\" and the Israeli government, while notoriously inefficient, will never persecute us as our previous landlords have. \"ארמי אבד אבי\" is over for good! Until they recognize this, I'm afraid that the friction within our faith here will never truly end. With Hashem's help, we will merit an appropriate balance of \"ארמי אבד אבי\" and \"ויבאנו אל המקום הזה,\" to properly appreciate the good we've been given without getting too caught up in the past difficulties. Through this, we will hopefully merit a complete גאולה very soon. Shabbat Shalom. share in social medias: Previous Update Next Update More Updates Where does Israel go from here?

As our new academic year approaches with the opening, we plan to offer a special scholarship to all students who have served in combat roles during the current operation in recognition of their brave service on our behalf. This is both a token of our appreciation and a recognition that for many of them life has been anything but normal and funds they had anticipated to use to pay tuition are no longer available to them Contribution to JCT's Combat Student Scholarship Fund can be made online or donated through any of the addresses below.

JCT opens Nursing Program for Haredi Men JPost on our new Nursing program for Haredi men 11.8.2014 CT opens Nursing Program for Haredi Men As many men in the haredi sector do not want to be treated by women, it will make them less hesitant to seek nursing care. For the first time, national religious and ultra-Orthodox haredi men who have passed psychometric exams will study for a four-year bachelor’s degree in nursing, The Jerusalem Post has learned. The program, which will begin in October at the Jerusalem College of Technology– Lev Academic Center, will help ease the shortage of nurses and provide observant men with a developing profession that is becoming more technological. In addition, as many men in the haredi sector do not want to be treated by women, it will make them less hesitant to seek nursing care. “This program sends a message to the religious community that nursing is no longer a female profession, no longer involves emptying bedpans, and is growing and advancing. Men, who can also work at irregular hours because their wives are taking care of the children then, can make a lot of money; they can also go into male-oriented specialties such as intensive care and take part in medics courses,” said Prof. Chaya Greenberger, the dean of JCT’s faculty of health and life sciences. Greenberger founded more than six years ago the nursing program at JCT’s separate women’s campus, Machon Tal, whose graduates have the highest nursing licensing grade in the country.

JCT Students to Represent Israel in Global Competition in Israel Zuta Labs continutes to make headlines! 28.8.2014 The Portable Printer A miniature and mobile printer landed Tuvia Elbaum and Matan Caspi, who is currently serving in the army reserves, first place in the Creative Cup Israel competition and the chance to represent Israel in the Creative Business Cup Competition in Denmark The national stage of the competition was held at the Shenkar College of Engineering and Design. During the finals of the national competition, 7 competitors presented their projects, of which a professional panel of judges selected a winner. The panel participated Prof. Yuli Tamir, President of Shenkar; Yoel Astron, Publisher of \"Calcalist\"; Ella Metlon, Chairman of the Global Entrepreneurship Week in Israel Foundation; Tami Varshevsky, Head of the Shenkar ACT Center for Innovation; Amit Harel, Manager of the Innovations Division of Deloitte; Doron Tal, Entrepreneur and Innovation Specialist; and Amanda Altorp Sorensan,  Trade and Innovation Advisor at the Denmark Embassy in Israel. The winners who placed first and second will attend the Global Creative Business Cup Competition in Denmark, and will compete against winners from 40 countries for the title of World's Most Creative Entrepreneur. The Zuta Labs project was initiated through the Friedberg Program for Entrepreneurial Excellence at the Jerusalem College of Technology, where Elbaum and Caspi were then studying towards their BA in Business Management. \"Several months ago, Microsoft Israel approached us to present at, Think Next, their annual exhibition, held in April,\" says Elbaum, who accepted the award for both himself and his partner who was called up to serve in the IDF reserves. \"We launched the Kickstarter campaign several days later, and ended up raising close to $500,000.\" It's not difficult to decipher why the Kickstarer campaign was so successful. \"The market already has small and mobile printers, but they only print on small paper. What's innovative about our product is that the paper doesn't pass through the printer, our printer travels over the paper,\" said Elbaum. \"The printer, which is about the size of a baseball, runs on batteries and can connect to a smartphone, tablet or laptop, and then simply rolls over the paper - no matter what size - and produces the image\". Elbaum and Caspi are currently in the process of developing and finalizing the project, and will be distributing the first printers to Kickstarter investors this January. \"We expect that by the end of the first quarter of 2015 the printers will be available on the market for $240.\" share in social medias: Previous Update Next Update More Updates Where does Israel go from here?

JCT Scientist Creates ‘Disappearing Capes’ to Protect Soldiers from Radiation How a JCT professor is working to protect soldiers from radiation 28.7.2014 Invisibility’ tech builds safer antenna for IDF Off in the future, IDF soldiers may get the ultimate battlefield armor - a Harry Potter-style \"invisibility cloak\" that could let them cross a battlefield right under the noses of their enemies - without being detected. In the meantime, the goals for using technology like that are a bit lower - but still important. Until those cloaks are ready for action, Professor Michael Bank of the Jerusalem College of Technology is using the \"metamaterials\" that could be used to build those invisible uniforms to protect soldiers in the field from electromagnetic radiation emitted by communications equipment. \"It's true that metamaterials can be used for invisibility cloaks, and that's a project we may work on one day,\" Bank told The Times of Israel. \"But for now, we are using it to keep radiation away from soldiers' heads and upper body.\" Bank is one of Israel's senior experts on communications and electricity, and the radiation that results from both. An immigrant from Russia, Bank has numerous patents to his name, including one that allows electricity to flow through a single wire instead of the two that are generally needed, saving as much as 50% in power use and cost. Bank also has done innovative work in the area of antennas - and it's those innovations that he is supplying to the IDF to help protect soldiers from radiation. \"Units in the field always have at least one soldier who is required to carry a large communications unit, and they usually carry them on their shoulders or back, right next to their head,\" said Bank. \"The systems have large transmitters and emit a large amount of electromagnetic radiation, which many scientists believe are the cause of diseases such as cancer. We designed a new antenna that keeps the radiation away from the heads of soldiers, without compromising the range or performance of the transmitter.\" To view the full piece of the Times of Israel website click here share in social medias: Previous Update Next Update More Updates Where does Israel go from here?

Parashat Hashavua - The Weekly Portion - Chukat JCT student Tzvi Silver on this week's parasha. 26.6.2014 FAITH IN THE IMPENDING IMPOSSIBLE Tzvi Silver, a student in his second year of studies towards a degree in Electronics Engineering at JCT's Lev Campus, on this week's parasha Our sidrah , after enlightening us to one of the most confusing mitzvot in the entire Oral and Written Torah ( פרה אדומה) , recounts the tragedies that befell Moshe's immediate family. In Parshat Chukat , Moshe's siblings Aharon and Miriam pass away, and each death takes its toll on the Jewish People. However, the news of the end of Moshe Rabbeinu's leadership as the consequence of a mistake at Mei Meriva, and his being banned from entering into the Land of Israel, is the most tragic of all. A close reading of the section of מי מריבה doesn't show Moshe making any major mistakes in relaying and executing G-d's words. G-d tells Moshe to speak to the rock and He even goes as far as saying \"והוצאת להם מים מן הסלע והשקית את העדה- And you shall bring forth water from the rock and give drink to the nation \" (במדבר כ:ח). However, when Moshe hits the rock and brings forth water to give the nation to drink, just as asked, Hashem is not pleased: וַיֹּאמֶר ה', אֶל-מֹשֶׁה וְאֶל-אַהֲרֹן, יַעַן לֹא-הֶאֱמַנְתֶּם בִּי, לְהַקְדִּישֵׁנִי לְעֵינֵי בְּנֵי יִשְׂרָאֵל--לָכֵן, לֹא תָבִיאוּ אֶת-הַקָּהָל הַזֶּה, אֶל-הָאָרֶץ, אֲשֶׁר-נָתַתִּי לָהֶם. And G-d said to Moshe and Aharon: Since you didn't believe in Me, to sanctify Myself before the eyes of the Children of Israel, therefore, you shall not bring this nation into the land that I will give them. (שם כ:יב) Wow. This seems like a little bit of a harsh punishment for G-d's faithful servants who seemed to have deviated only minimally (if that) from G-d's script, hitting the rock instead of speaking to it. Why are they punished so harshly for this mistake? Furthermore, how on earth did Moshe's hitting the rock instead of speaking to it constitute \"יען לא האמנתם בי\"? Rashi answers our questions by taking a p'shat approach, a rarity in his commentary on Torah. He teaches that based on our passuk , G-d is not pleased with Moshe and Aharon because their actions demonstrated a lack of faith in G-d fulfilling His promise to let water flow from the rock. This isn't such a difficult situation to imagine: Moshe and Aharon are yet again facing a crowd of scared Jews who feel like they are in danger and are heading towards more. In the past, such situations have been resolved through strong and miraculous counterattacks (the earth swallowing up Korach, a plague killing the Spies, etc). However, here, the response seems somewhat less exciting. Imagine what could happen; Moshe and Aharon would gather the people in front of a rock, and then ask the rock nicely for water. But, what if this failed? What if it was the wrong rock? They would be overrun by the rioting nation before they had a chance to cry out \"Hashem.\" In order to prevent this potential problem, Moshe and Aharon took more direct action- they hit the rock with the staff, showing a lack of faith in the process. It is for this reason that their error was so serious and they did not merit to enter Eretz Yisrael. Rashi's answer leads to another question. Now that we understand why Moshe and Aharon were considered lacking in faith, we must ask why they were punished by being barred from entering the Holy Land? What is the connection between a lack of faith and entering Eretz Yisrael? As anyone with minimal expertise in Tanach or Modern Jewish History knows, Eretz Yisrael is the world capital of G-d's doing the impossible, His constant fulfillment of \"להקדישיני לעיני בני ישראל\" (and the rest of the world). In the times of Moshe's successor Yehoshua, Yericho's city wall disappeared in a burst of shofar blasts, and the land was conquered from the seven nations against all odds. Jumping forward to more recent times, the land of Israel was won back in a defensive war that turned the Arabs' planned Judenrein Palestine into their eternal Nakba. Six defensive wars later, the Jewish state is still safe and going strong, and the British territory that was defended by small militias has now grown up to a fully fledged country with the most advanced military in the Middle East. In the past sixty seven years, we have truly fought against the odds, but our faith in G-d's ability to sanctify Himself before us and before the nations has kept us on top. However, not all of our Jewish brothers share this faith. Rav Teichtel, a חוזר בתושבה from the Anti-Zionist world before meeting his tragic end in Nazi Europe, speaks many times of the Religious world's attitude towards Secular Zionism. In his time, they questioned how a non-religious movement could ever lead to the גאולה, and they even shunned leaders like Theodor Herzl from receiving any support from the religious world. Jumping to our times, even after the יד השם has been clearly revealed in Israel's short but exciting history, the question has quite possibly grown even stronger. Many of the Ultra-Orthodox Jews living in the Diaspora still possess this doubt- despite positions by distinguished gedolim , they cannot imagine how a secular state will ever yield the long-anticipated redemption. We've previously discussed how silly this view is in the context of G-d's ability to do anything . Now, in light of Rashi's answer above, this incorrect view takes on a new dimension. These misled Jews' views demonstrate that they are making the same mistake as Moshe and Aharon- they don't have faith in G-d's ability to sanctify Himself in front of the nations, whether through speaking to a rock, or through an unlikely secular state. They cannot comprehend what many less religious people have, that the state of Israel is an eternal source of קידוש השם, and has done nothing but sanctify His name (through showing the miracles He does for His chosen nation), and therefore, they risk missing out on an opportunity that Moshe and Aharon never had a chance to experience- the chance to see redemption and return to Eretz Yisrael. With this in mind, we can now understand why Moshe and Aharon were barred from entering the Holy Land. Eretz Yisrael is a land of faith in the G-d's ability to do the impossible- those who lack this faith have no place to live there, and do not deserve the great honor of calling the Promised Land their home. Moshe and Aharon, who were on such a high level, lost this opportunity after such a minute mistake, because of this lack of faith. In our times, where we are not on nearly such a high level, the non-believers do not receive such harsh decrees. Even the biggest כופר still has a chance to do תשובה, by returning home and showing his faith in G-d's ability to do the impending impossible- bringing the גאולה through a secular state. With Hashem's help, we will see all of our Jewish brothers, no matter how misled, embracing their faith in G-d's ability to the impossible, so that we can merit the קיבוץ גליות, very speedily in our days.

Parashat Hashavua - The Weekly Portion - Shelach Home Page News and Updates ... Parashat Hashavua - The Weekly Portion - Shelach JCT student Tzvi Silver on this week's parasha. 11.6.2014 THE SIN OF THE SPIES: FEAR-MONGERING THE UNKNOWN Tzvi Silver, a student in his second year of studies towards a degree in Electronics Engineering at JCT's Lev Campus, on this week's parasha In psychology, it is well-known that the greatest fear that faces all of mankind is fear of the unknown. But, as iconic American actor Tom Hanks famously said \"A hero is somebody who voluntarily walks into the unknown.\" Our heroes are the ones who have the privilege and responsibility of going out into the unknown, no matter how scary- they go out into the unfamiliar and make it known to us, so we have no need to fear it anymore. In this week's parsha , as the Jewish People prepare to enter Eretz Yisrael, G-d commands the Jewish People to send spies into the unknown of the Holy Land, so that they'll know what to expect upon entering. Unfortunately, these so-called heroes did not live up to their responsibilities- they ended up taking advantage of the Jews' natural fear of the foreign to scare them away from Eretz Yisrael. This ends up leading to one of the biggest tragedies to the Jews of the wilderness, causing an entire generation to miss out on the opportunity to enter the land, and starting a plague so bad that it became the first of too many tragedies that we commemorate on the ninth of Av. This story begs the question: The Jewish People were doing relatively well at that point. Whoever was left alive at that point had survived two rounds of meat complaints, and had witnessed first-hand the cost of the sin of Lashon Hara (seeing Miriam's tzarat ). How could their spies, who are described in the pesukim as \"כולם אנשים ראשי בני ישראל המה- they were all heads of the Jewish People, distinguished men \" (במדבר יג:ג), have made a such a grievous error? How could the Jews' heroes, in pursuit of clearing the unknown from their journey, have gone so wrong? Before answering this question, I would like to add another one. Many commentators debate whether or not Moshe's spending spies was a correct move. From our pesukim , it's clear that not only was this justified, but G-d commanded it (if anyone is in doubt of this, based on Rashi's commentary on \"שלך-לך,\" please see the two similarly worded \"לך-לך\" commands in Bereshit, which were clearly not optional). So, why would G-d command Moshe to send spies when it 's clear that there was so much room for error? The answers to our questions lie in how the spies reacted to their time in the land. After being sent, they spend 40 days touring the land, going on tiyulim , visiting the holy sites, and doing other agricultural recreational activities. However, once they return, their report does not seem to reflect their experience at all. They discuss scary details of the Jews' enemies there while failing to talk about the nice parts, ending with their main argument: לֹא נוּכַל, לַעֲלוֹת אֶל-הָעָם:  כִּי-חָזָק הוּא, מִמֶּנּוּ We will not be able to bring the nation there, for it is too difficult for us . (יג:לא) Ramban comments here that this was the spies' main point and plan the entire time. From the beginning, they aimed to influence the Jewish People not to go to Eretz Yisrael- they betrayed the trust of the people they represented, and increased the Jews' fear of the Holy Land instead of calming their phobia of their unknown future home. When push comes to shove, their entire journey to Israel was a crock- before they left, they had already pre-judged Eretz Yisrael, and had already concluded that they would not be able to get there, so, despite the positive experience that Yehoshua and Calev managed to have, they gave a dishonest report to the Jewish People. This could explain why G-d commanded Moshe to send spies- in the hope that seeing the land would cause them to reconsider the attitude of pre-judging the land, letting their fear of the unknown influence their decision to follow G-d to His promised land. Since this plan failed, the spies died in the ensuing plague, while the entire generation that accepted their evil report did not end up meriting entering the land that they were tricked into fearing. While G-d definitely knew this would happen, He nonetheless gave them a chance to try to break out of their own preconceptions, and there was therefore nothing wrong with the sending of the spies. Even though we can now understand why G-d sent spies to Eretz Yisrael and why this was a good idea, it's still very hard to reconcile how so many Jewish leaders, the gedolim of their time, could've gone so wrong. Why would they have decided to mislead the nation like this? Rav Teichtel, in the second chapter of Em Habanim Semecha , addresses our question by quoting a piece from the Tana Debe Eliyahu : בתנא דביה אליהו (פרק א'): \"'לשמור את הדרך'- זו דרך ארץ, 'עץ החיים'- מלמד שדרך ארץ קדמה לעץ החיים, ואין 'עץ החיים' אלא תורה, שנאמר 'עץ חיים היא למחזיקים בה.'\" וכתב הרב הגאן הצדיק הנ\"ל בפירושו וזה לשונו: \"'מלמד שדרך ארץ קדמה לעץ החיים'- וצריך ביאור, איזהו דרך ארץ מכוון בזה? ולפי המבואר בילקוט 'כי נגרשו מן הארץ- זה ארץ ישראל,' אפשר לומר דמשמע לן לאפוקי... מן דעת המרגלים אשר מאסו הארץ, ואמרו תורה מוקדם לארץ ישראל, על כן בקשו שלא ליכנס לארץ ישראל, כי אם להיות נשאר במדבר ללמוד תורה מפי משה רבנו עליו השלום, שלא נתנה תורה אלא לאוכלי המן. על כן בא לומר כי דרך ארץ...זה הדרך המביא לארץ, הוא מוקדם לתורה, כמו שכתוב בספרי 'מלמד שישיבת הארץ מכריע את כל הארץ.'\" עד כאן דיבורו. In a nutshell, Rav Teichtel quotes a teaching which first proves that living in Eretz Yisrael comes before learning Torah (\"דרך ארץ קדמה לתורה\"). Then, he quotes a teaching of Rav Akiva Yosef Shlezinger (zt\"l, called \"הרב הגאון הצדיק\" in the text), which tells us that the spies were not evil men at all- they cared a lot about Torah learning, and believed that it was tantamount, even preceding G-d's will to bring the Jews to Eretz Yisrael. They didn't want to enter the Promised Land because they saw their state in the wilderness as an ideal- they were learning Torah from Moshe, fed by G-d's manna, and didn't have a worry in the world. They didn't want to leave this perceived ideal to enter Eretz Yisrael and have to work the land for a living, learning less Torah in the process. Therefore, they prejudged the Land for bad, and influenced all of the Jews to want to remain in the desert, defying G-d's will in the process. In essence, they decided that in order to save their Torah learning, they should stop the Jews' redemption, and these resha'im ended up paying dearly for their mistake, not only being punished themselves but also leaving the generation unfortunate enough to listen to their heresy to die in the wilderness. In our times, we face a similar problem. There are a lot of people who do not want to move to Eretz Yisrael because the journey is too difficult (\"כי חזק הוא ממנו\"). Others are wary of the possible loss to their עבודת השם. While the latter is not easy to digest in light of the Tana Debe Eliyahu above, these are definitely valid views, and one does nothing wrong by feeling them. What is definitely not okay, however, is channeling these negative feelings to influence those around us to make the same mistake. Fear of the unknown is extremely common in the Hareidi world in regards to Yishuv Ha'aretz, and anyone who exploits this to turn another Jew away from Israel, especially someone who has already been there and known about her goodness, is no better than the spies in our parsha , who were killed in a terrible plague for the sin of their misleading. Fear of the unknown is healthy, but fear mongering is not, and resha'im of our times who spread דיבות רעות on Artzeinu Hakedosha to promote their incorrect values system cannot possibly understand the detriment they are causing to our people in delaying our redemption just as their predecessors in the wilderness did then. With Hashem's help, we will see a fulfillment of our daily prayer of \"וכל הרשע כרגע תאבד\" by seeing an end to Jews' misleading their brothers, and through this, we will iy\"h merit a complete redemption very soon. share in social medias: Previous Update Next Update More Updates Where does Israel go from here?

Parashat Hashavua - The Weekly Portion -Beha'alotcha Home Page News and Updates ... Parashat Hashavua - The Weekly Portion -Beha'alotcha JCT student Tzvi Silver on this week's parasha. 5.8.2014 SPORADIC SPIRITUAL SOJOURNS Tzvi Silver, a student in his second year of studies towards a degree in Electronics Engineering at JCT's Lev Campus, on this week's parasha Our parsha is distinctly divided into two sections, split in the middle with the short section of “ויהי בנסוע הארון,” where we read of the procedures that בני ישראל would go through before setting out for and settling in from their travels. I would like to focus a little bit on the lifestyle that these travels forced on בני ישראל. If we look earlier in the פרשה, we see: וּלְפִי הֵעָלוֹת הֶעָנָן, מֵעַל הָאֹהֶל–וְאַחֲרֵי-כֵן, יִסְעוּ בְּנֵי יִשְׂרָאֵל; וּבִמְקוֹם, אֲשֶׁר יִשְׁכָּן-שָׁם הֶעָנָן–שָׁם יַחֲנוּ, בְּנֵי יִשְׂרָאֵל. עַל - פִּי ה ’, יִסְעוּ בְּנֵי יִשְׂרָאֵל , וְעַל - פִּי ה ’, יַחֲנוּ : …וְיֵשׁ אֲשֶׁר יִהְיֶה הֶעָנָן, יָמִים מִסְפָּר–עַל-הַמִּשְׁכָּן; עַל - פִּי ה ’ יַחֲנוּ , וְעַל - פִּי ה ’ יִסָּעוּ . וְיֵשׁ אֲשֶׁר-יִהְיֶה הֶעָנָן, מֵעֶרֶב עַד-בֹּקֶר, וְנַעֲלָה הֶעָנָן בַּבֹּקֶר, וְנָסָעוּ; אוֹ יוֹמָם וָלַיְלָה, וְנַעֲלָה הֶעָנָן וְנָסָעוּ. אוֹ-יֹמַיִם אוֹ-חֹדֶשׁ אוֹ-יָמִים, בְּהַאֲרִיךְ הֶעָנָן עַל-הַמִּשְׁכָּן לִשְׁכֹּן עָלָיו, יַחֲנוּ בְנֵי-יִשְׂרָאֵל, וְלֹא יִסָּעוּ; וּבְהֵעָלֹתוֹ, יִסָּעוּ . עַל - פִּי ה ’ יַחֲנוּ , וְעַל - פִּי ה ’ יִסָּעוּ . אֶת-מִשְׁמֶרֶת ה’ שָׁמָרוּ, עַל-פִּי ה’ בְּיַד-מֹשֶׁה (במדבר ט’: י”ז-כ”ג) These פסוקים, aside from being extremely repetitive, highlight how religiously בני ישראל followed G-d’s commands to start traveling and stop traveling. Sometimes, they would have to encamp in the same place for months at a time, other times, they would stay where they were for only a few hours. No matter what the conditions, they would always start moving on G-d’s signal, and they would stop moving on G-d’s signal- truly “על פי ה’ יחנו, ועל פי ה’ יסעו,” a phrase repeated many times in this small section. The מפורשים grapple with the significance of this repetitive language: Rashi (9:17) answers that the repetitive nature of our section teaches us that when בני ישראל were commanded to travel, they always, without fail, followed the procedure that we are told about later in the פרשה, namely “ויהי בנסוע הארון ויאמר משה ‘קומה ה’ ויפוצו אויבך וינסו משנאיך מפניך,’” and when they were told to stop,  “ובנחה יאמר שובה ה’ רבבי אלפי ישראל,” as explained there. This did not vary, and they would often have to drop what they were doing to give this ceremony the proper attention, which was a huge merit for them, and big מוסר for us whenever we do not feel up to doing מצות in a timely manner. While רש”י learns that the emphasis of the travels is a lesson in their attitude towards their travels, רמב”ן teaches a lesson more about the types of travels that בני ישראל faced on their trips: לומר כי אם יאריך הענן על המשכן ימים רבים, והמקום ההוא איננו טוב בעיניהם והיו חפצים ומתאוים מאד לנסוע מן המקום, אעפ”כ לא יעברו על רצון השם. וזה טעם ושמרו בני ישראל את משמרת ה’ ולא יסעו – כי מיראת השם ומשמרם משמרת מצותו לא יסעו. וכן אם יהיה הענן ימים מספר כשנים או שלשה ימים, והיו העם יגעים מאד וענה בדרך כחם, יעשו רצון השם ללכת אחרי הענן… This teaches us that sometimes the Anan would remain in the Mishkan for many days, and that place may not be good for them and they would want to leave for someplace more suitable- despite this, they would not go against G-d’s will. This explains “And Israel guarded the word of G-d and didn’t travel”- because their fear of G-d and following Mitzvot kept them from traveling. So too, if the Anan would move for a few days and the nation would be tired and run out of strength, they would still follow G-d’s command to follow the Anan… (רמב”ן ט’:י”ט). Ramban goes onto explain the other difficult situations that בני ישראל would go through in their travels, such as traveling only at nights sometimes, or long travels on difficult terrains. No matter what they faced, they didn’t complain and always followed G-d’s ענן on the treacherous travels through the wilderness. We can learn a very important lesson from בני ישראל’s attitude here. בני ישראל were on a journey from their enslavement in ארץ מצרים, a national low, to their promised land in ארץ ישראל. Looking back at their journey millennia later, we know that G-d did not take them on the most direct way to Israel, instead leading them on the ‘scenic route of Sinai.’ Nevertheless, despite the long travels and uncomfortable camps without an end in sight, they did not stop and give up. They kept on going because they knew what their יעוד (destiny) was- to inherit their land and become a nation. This motivation kept them going through their travels, despite the comfortable stops they might have made along the way. In his introduction to אם הבנים שמחה, Rav Teichtel quotes a short, but potent Midrash: נטל הקב”ה שיחתן של אבות ועשאן מפתח לגאולה של בנים G-d took occurrences of our forefathers and applied them to the redemption of His children. (בראשית רבה פרשה ע’, אות ו’) While this מדרש was written in the context of יעקב’s promise to G-d to return to ארץ ישראל safely in פרשת ויצא, I believe it applies equally well to our פרשה. Judaism is a religion that relies heavily on precedent- “מעשה אבות סימן לבנים” is a huge factor in making decisions on a personal level and on a national level, and we cannot disregard lessons from our forefathers if they could affect or change our lives. Based on this, I would like to suggest an approach for applying the lesson of בני ישראל’s travels to our lives. The Jewish People have been on a spiritual journey for the past 2000+ years. We left Jerusalem in ruins after the חורבן בית שני, and have been wandering through the wilderness since then, being led by G-d through the lands of our enemies waiting to continue our journey to the Holy Land. At times, He has told us to stop, and we have stopped and camped there, no matter how uncomfortable, until we are told to get up again when He gives His sign for us to leave. Unfortunately, our long גלות has robbed us of the motivation and ethic of the Jewish People of פרשת בהעלותך. We have lost sight of our destination, focusing instead on the comfortable ‘stopping place’ that G-d has placed us in for the past century or so, to the point that now, as G-d has lifted the cloud for us to travel again, we deign to stay in the land of our enemies, ignoring our final destination even as we are now on the homestretch to the גאולה. We as a nation must be מתחזק from the lesson of the emphasis of בני ישראל’s travels in פרק ט’ of ספר במדבר, so that we can internalize the message and implications of “על פי ה’ יחנו ועל פי ה’ יסעו,” and by doing so, we can end the 2000-year-old spiritual journey of the Jewish People by reaching the final destination of our physical travels. Only through this can we end our sojourns in our enemies’ land, end the physical and spiritual journeys of the Jewish People, and fulfill our destiny as our ancestors did in the wilderness by bringing an end to our גלות, very speedily in our days.

Elbaum and Caspi were able to pursue their innovation after being accepted into an elite program at JCT known as The Friedberg Program for Entrepreneurial Excellence, which gives students the opportunity to advance entrepreneurial ideas from the “exploratory” to the “concrete” stages—offering them financial assistance, mentoring, workshops, and more in order to help make their ideas become a reality. The pair of entrepreneurs then formed a new company called ZUtA Labs Ltd., and launched a fundraising campaign on Kickstarter, which according to Elbaum “succeeded in raising over 125 percent of what we wanted (more than half a million dollars), and included some big names, like Steve Wozniak, co-founder of Apple .” While the pocket printer is still “a project in the making,” Elbaum said those who offered their financial backing “really wanted to be part of creating this product, which is incredible and [demonstrates] the true power of Kickstarter.” He hopes to “reward” those who contributed via Kickstarter by shipping them the first batch of the finished mobile printers in January 2015.  \" share in social medias: Previous Update Next Update More Updates Where does Israel go from here?

Parashat Hashavua - The Weekly Portion - Naso JCT student Tzvi Silver on this week's parasha. 29.5.2014 NASO: STAYING COMMITTED TO OUR CAPITAL Tzvi Silver, a student in his second year of studies towards a degree in Electronics Engineering at JCT's Lev Campus, on this week's parasha This past Wednesday, as the Jewish People of Israel celebrated the forty-seventh anniversary of the freeing of our nation's capital, a lot of politicians were taking advantage of the opportunity to \"talk the talk\". At Tuesday night's official ceremony at Yeshivat Merkaz Harav, Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu, promised \"We are protecting the heart of the nation- we will never divide our heart… Jerusalem was united 47 years ago and will never be divided again.\" The next day, at the annual Yom Yerushalayim concert at the Kotel, Economy Minister Naftali Bennett echoed a similar theme; \"My brothers and sisters- On this day when soldiers called out ' Har Habayit B'yadeinu ,' we must vow never to divide our city again, and to remember the promise ' Im Eshkachaich Yerushalayim Tishkach Yemini '…\" he declared, before breaking into song and leading an emotional rendition of the well-known melody. Having been present at the latter, I can say firsthand that the declaration was very well received. While promises are very easy to make, as Napoleon Bonaparte famously said \"The best way to keep one's word is not to give it.\" Why? Because, it's all too easy to make promises, especially at the emotional climax of one of the happiest days on the modern Jewish calendar, but what is much harder to do is \"walk the walk,\" and fulfill them later. This idea is exemplified in our parsha , where we read of the inauguration of the Mishkan. The Jewish People are given the Priestly Blessing for the first time, then we are presented with the exhaustive and repetitive list of the offerings of each of the twelve Jewish leaders. Then, we are given a final count of the total number of animals brought as offerings. Finally, in conclusion, we read: זֹאת חֲנֻכַּת הַמִּזְבֵּחַ אַחֲרֵי הִמָּשַׁח אֹתוֹ This is the inauguration of the altar, after it was anointed (במדבר ז:פח) To the casual observer, nothing seems to be amiss here. However, to the dedicated reader, one who had read the previous eighty seven pesukim which describe the inauguration process ad nasueam , there is room to wonder why the passuk had to add the words \"אחרי המשח אתו.\" They  could either serve as an extremely unnecessary reminder of the setting of the perek , or even as a contradiction to the previous pesukim , which seem to suggest that all of the aforementioned happened during the inauguration of the Mishkan, not afterwards. Rav Avraham Mordechai Alter of Gor, the third Gerrer Rebbe, answers our question in his flagship work, Imrei Emes . He teaches that this seemingly unnecessary and unhelpful phrase actually teaches us an important lesson in midot . The pesukim leading up to our summary one describe the service in the Mishkan on the day of its inauguration, when, through all of the spiritual and emotional highs, people were more likely to keep these teachings properly with a zeal. However, once this hallowed celebration was over, it could be more difficult to complete the avoda properly. To show that the Jewish People were able to overcome this difficult challenge, the passuk specifically says \"זאת חנוכת המזבח אחרי המשח אתו- even after the inauguration was finished, the people still followed the rules of the avoda properly, as if it was still the same day that the altar was inaugurated. I believe that the Israeli politicians who were very outspoken on Wednesday would do well to heed the warning of the Admo\"r of Gor. During the amazing high of Yom Yerushalayim, it is all too easy to make promises  to keep the \"עיר שחוברה לה יחדיו\" together.  But, what happens the next day, \"אחרי המשח אתו\"? Will Prime Minister Netanyahu still feel as strongly about never dividing the heart of the Jewish People. Will Minister Bennett still stand by his promise to keep Jerusalem together as if it was his own right arm? Wednesday may have been a time of promises, but today is a time of action. At the time of this writing, half of our holy city is occupied by its approximately 290,000 Muslim residents, demanding that \"East Jerusalem\" be recognized as the capital of their Palestinian state. The holiest site in Judaism was closed to Jews on the forty-seventh anniversary of \"הר הבית בידינו,\" because of Muslim rioters. Jerusalem may not be divided right now, but she is unfortunately far from being fully united. Even the politicians who are outspoken about Jerusalem's unity have not made enough effort to begin to unite her. So, I repeat again, the time has come for actions, not promises. In Tehilim 137, we read: \"אם אשכחך ירושלים... תדבק לשוני לחכי\" If I forget you Jerusalem… Let my tongue stick to the roof of my mouth (תהילים קיז:ה-ו) It is no coincidence that David Hamelech used this specific metaphor in the context of remembering Jerusalem. When we forget Jerusalem, we cannot begin talking, we must only take action to ensure that we never forget her again. With Hashem's help, we will see Jerusalem completely reunited very soon, through G-d's might and politicians' honesty, so that she will never be forgotten ever again. share in social medias: Previous Update Next Update More Updates Where does Israel go from here?

Parashat Hashavua - The Weekly Portion - Bemidbar Home Page News and Updates ... Parashat Hashavua - The Weekly Portion - Bemidbar JCT student Tzvi Silver on this week's parasha 22.5.2014 HISHTADLUT FOR HOPELESS ENDEAVORS Tzvi Silver, a student in his second year of studies towards a degree in Electronics Engineering at JCT's Lev Campus, on this week's parasha The following D'var Torah was inspired by my chavruta in Torat Eretz Yisrael , Ari Gordon. Vince Lombardi, a former owner of the Green Bay Packers and well-known name to those who frequent the New Jersey Turnpike, is famously quoted as saying \"Individual commitment to a group effort- that is what makes a team work, a company work, a society work, a civilization work.\" Former UK Prime Minister Winston Churchill spoke along the same lines, saying \"Continuous effort- not strength or intelligence- is the key to unlocking our potential.\" While none of the aforementioned have a particularly close connection to Judaism (though Churchill did help establish the Jewish State with his 1922 White Paper), their messages are very much in line with our faith's philosophy on life.  In a world which judges purely on results, the Jewish People stand out as a nation whose religious observance is not about the results, but the journey. Mesechet Avot teaches \"it is not for you to finish the work, nor are you free to desist from it,\" showing that our life-long mission is to continuously invest effort into Avodat Hashem . However, Lombardi and Churchill take this philosophy to a societal level- if we, as a nation, want to ensure our future, we must put in a collective effort to make a future. How do we do this, you may ask. I believe we need to look no further than our parsha , where Am Yisrael is counted as a whole in preparation to enter Eretz Yisrael , to see an important lesson in individual and communal efforts. In our parsha , Moshe Rabeinu is faced with a daunting task. He is commanded by G-d to take a census of the Jewish People, those aged twenty years and older, for army service, a huge undertaking. Moshe collects the half-shekel coins of all of those countedand presents his tally. Then, Moshe is given an even more complex assignment: וַיְדַבֵּר יְקֹוָק אֶל מֹשֶׁה בְּמִדְבַּר סִינַי לֵאמֹר. פְּקֹד אֶת בְּנֵי לֵוִי לְבֵית אֲבֹתָם לְמִשְׁפְּחֹתָם כָּל זָכָר מִבֶּן חֹדֶשׁ וָמַעְלָה תִּפְקְדֵם. And Hashem spoke to Moshe in the Wilderness of Sinai saying: Count all of the descendants of Levi by their families, every male from one month and up shall be counted . (במדבר ג:יד-טו) Moshe is told to count all of the male Levites, aged one month and up, a particularly difficult assignment since infants of that age aren't usually able to give in a half-shekel coin for the census. Nonetheless, Moshe once again comes through: וַיִּפְקֹד אֹתָם מֹשֶׁה עַל פִּי יְקֹוָק כַּאֲשֶׁר צֻוָּה And Moshe counted them, by the word of G-d, as he was commanded . (שם טז) As my sixth-grade English teacher has told me on all-too-many occasions; \"Something doesn't need to be here…\" Why do we need to be explicitely told that Moshe's count was both \"על פי ה',\" and also \"כאשר צוה.\" Rashi answers by connecting the words \"על פי ה'\" to the difficulty of Moshe's task: על פי ה ' - אמר משה לפני הקב\"ה היאך אני נכנס לבתי כלם ולתוך אהליהם לדעת מנין יונקיהם. אמר לו הקב\"ה עשה אתה את שלך ואני אעשה את שלי. הלך משה ועמד על פתח האהל והשכינה מקדמת לפניו, ובת קול יוצאת מן האהל ואומרת כך וכך תינוקות יש באהל זה, לכך נאמר על פי ה': On The Word of Hashem- Moshe said before G-d: How can I enter everyone's homes and tents to know exactly how many infants there are? G-d responded to him: Do your (effort), and I will do mine. Moshe went and stopped in the entrances to the tents with G-d's presence following him, and a divine voice would call out from the tent and say \"there are X babies in this tent,\" and this is why [the passuk ] says \"על פי ה'.\" (רש\"י שם) This Midrashic teaching shows us a clear message: the importance of השתדלות, of making an effort. When faced with daunting, seemingly impossible tasks, we can take one of two routes; we can admit defeat, noting that nothing can possibly be done to reach our goal. However, Rashi's message here is that even when all hope is lost and something seems beyond our reach, we must give it our best effort- why? Because, if our intentions are pure, G-d will help us out. \"עשה אתה שלך ואני אעשה את שלי- Put in your best effort, and I, G-d, will do the rest.\" It is because of this השתדלות that Moshe was able to complete his count of the thousands of Levites. The idea of השתדלות has become a bit of a buzz word in the context of the גאולה in recent decades. This seven letter word which seems to have such a simple meaning, has been taken in many different directions to return to the same goal. On Sunday, the Lubavitch chasidim of Jerusalem put on several Lag B'omer parades throughout the city. Their message was clear; in order to bring the Mashiach , השתדלות must be focused on small, doable mitzvot on a global scale. Along with the \"יחי אדונינו\" flags, flyers were given out emphasizing the importance of the mitzvot of lighting Shabbat candles, putting up mezuzot , and wearing tefilin every day. The claim of the rabbis leading the group on Ben Yehuda street on Sunday afternoon was that if every Jew can keep a few basic commandments and focus their השתדלות on these, then the Mashiach will return… ( cough )… come. On the other extreme, the less chasidic Hareidi world has a different spin on השתדלות. They believe that our השתדלות should be focused on personal introspection. If we can work on repenting for our sins and perfecting ourselves, then surely G-d will do the rest. While these are both extremely valid and important goals for each and every one of us, when it comes to bringing the Mashiach , I believe that it is clear from our parsha that the השתדלות (with a capital \"ה\") to bring the geulah is through actions, by doing the ultimate השתדלות of leaving everything behind and coming to the Promised Land, embracing the geulah even if sacrifices are required. I would like to present a section from Rav Yissachar Teichtel's Em Habanim Semecha , an essential work in the arsenal of all Religious Zionists, which expands on this idea of השתדלות. In the second chapter of Em Habanim Semecha , Rav Teichtel discusses the process of earning and executing the redemption, one step at a time. Step seven intially discusses the importance of relying on only G-d to bring the Mashiach , then continues to the theme of השתדלות. Rav Teichtel writes: ואחר היגיעה, האיר ה' את עיני למצוא פשר בדבר זה, על אריכות הגלות אף שכבר הגיעה זמנה של \"בעתה.\" דהנה, הושע הנביא אומר: \"אחר ישובו בני ישראל ובקשו את ה' אלקיהם ואת דוד מלכם ופחדו אל ה' ואל טובו באחרית הימים.\" ואמרו חז\"ל על פסוק זה: \"לא גלו ישראל אלא משום שמאסו בני ישראל בשלושה דברים: במלכות שמים, ובמלכות דוד, ובבית המקדש... ...And after [I thought about this,] G-d opened my eyes to find reconciliation in this matter, on the lengthening of the exile even though the time for redemption has already come. This is what Hoshea wrote: \"Afterwards, the Children of Israel will return and ask from G-d, and for David their king, and they will fear G-d and all of his good, at the end of days.\" And Chazal say on this passuk : \"The Jewish People were exiled because they hated three things: G-d's Kingship, Davidic kingship, and the Temple… (אם הבנים שמחה פרק שני, אות ז) Further on, Rav Teichtel clarifies what exactly \"בקשה\" means here: היינו דתפילה בלא עסק ועסק בלא תפילה, לא מהני. For prayer without action, and action without prayer, is incomplete. (שם) The message is crystal clear here. We were exiled from our land thousands of years ago for three major sins. Right now (read: in the time of Rav Teichtel, about seventy years ago), we are nearing אחרית הימים. But reaching the time of Mashiach is not enough. We must learn from the lessons of Vince Lombardi and Prime Minister Churchill, and take action, put in effort, to enable our civilization and nation to continue. As the different sects of Religious Judaism debate how to go about this, only one result has shown any serious progress; the השתדלות of returning home, for as Hoshea prophesied, only  \"אחר ישובו בני ישראל- after the Jewish People return,\" can they \"ובקשו…- beg for redemption.\"  Even though the prospect of putting in such serious השתדלות and מסירות נפש can be extremely daunting, we only need to look at Moshe Rabeinu's attitude in the parsha to realize that if we put in our השתדלות, then G-d will help. All we need to do is take the first step, reaffirm our \"individual commitment to group effort\" as Lombardi said by doing serious השתדלות, and come home. With this in mind, may we all merit to reach a fulfillment of Hoshea's prophecy by meriting the coming of the Mashiach and the End of Days, very soon.

Parashat Hashavua - The Weekly Portion - Bechukotai Home Page News and Updates ... Parashat Hashavua - The Weekly Portion - Bechukotai JCT student Tzvi Silver on this week's parasha. 15.5.2014 ESCAPING THE TOCHACHA Tzvi Silver, a student in his second year of studies towards a degree in Electronics Engineering at JCT's Lev Campus, on this week's parasha Parshat Bechukotai contains many important, repeated themes in the Jewish People's history and future. It opens with the bracha , a very generally-termed promise of the good things that will happen if we follow G-d's Will. Then, it tells of the bone-chilling tochacha , the five stage admonition that tells us in very specific and not uncertain terms what will happen to us if we fail to earn the bracha . Then, we learn of G-d's promise to preserve us, even when we are at our lowest: וְזָכַרְתִּי, אֶת-בְּרִיתִי יַעֲקוֹב; וְאַף אֶת-בְּרִיתִי יִצְחָק וְאַף אֶת-בְּרִיתִי אַבְרָהָם, אֶזְכֹּר--וְהָאָרֶץ אֶזְכֹּר... וְאַף-גַּם-זֹאת בִּהְיוֹתָם בְּאֶרֶץ אֹיְבֵיהֶם, לֹא-מְאַסְתִּים וְלֹא-גְעַלְתִּים לְכַלֹּתָם--לְהָפֵר בְּרִיתִי, אִתָּם:  כִּי אֲנִי ה', אֱלֹקֵיהֶם. And I shall then remember my promise to Yaakov and also my promise to Yitzchak and even my promise to Avraham- I will remember these and the land will remember them… And no matter what, when they are in their enemies' land, I will not reject them nor abhor them, to destroy them forever, to break my promise with them, for I am Hashem their G-d . (ויקרא כו:מב,מד) With this small \"silver lining,\" this slightly reassuring safety net, the terrifying tochacha closes. While it is very reassuring that no matter how badly we misbehave, G-d will never completely destroy our people, it's very interesting to note that there is no mention of a happy ending after the admonition. G-d will never forget, and never let us be completely destroyed. He'll remember His promise to us and act on it, but what exactly does this entail? What is the endgame for the chosen people when they choose to return to G-d? In order to strengthen our question, I would like to remind everyone of the famous Meshech Chachma on the end of the tochacha , which puts our entire parsha into a historical perspective. Rav Meir Simcha HaKohen of Davinsk, the author of the Meshech Chachma , writes that all of Jewish history since the destruction of the Second Bet Hamikdash can be seen as an unfortunate and repetitive cycle. Two thousand years ago, the Jewish People were exiled from our land because of our sins, because we did not properly respect G-d nor fellow Jews. Ever since then, we have wandered from land to land, with the same pattern repeating itself every time. The Jews, kicked out of their home away from home, would settle in a new land, initially cautious as they built their separate communities and Torah centers. However, as time goes on, the Jews become successful in their new environment and begin to want to \"fit in\" to their new host culture, leaving Torah values behind in the process, as is written in the Meshech Chachma : יבקר ברעיון כוזב את אשר הנחילו אבותינו, ישער חדשות בשכוח מה היה לאומתו בהתנודדו בים התלאות, ויהיה מה. עוד מעט ישוב לאמר “שקר נחלו אבותינו”, והישראלי בכלל ישכח מחצבתו ויחשב לאזרח רענן. יעזוב לימודי דתו, ללמוד לשונות לא לו, יליף מקלקלתא ולא יליף מתקנא, יחשוב כי ברלין היא ירושלים, וכמקולקלים שבהם עשיתם כמתוקנים לא עשיתם. “ואל תשמח ישראל אל גיל כעמים” (הושע ט, א). … He will imagine new things, forgetting what happened to his nation when it staggered in a sea of troubles, no matter how bad it was. Soon enough, he will say ‘our fathers gave us an inheritance of lies.’ This Jew, will forget from where he came, considering himself to be a native of his adopted country. He will stop studying Judaism to begin learning languages that are not his own. He will learn from the corrupt ways of the gentiles, and not from our good ways. He will think that Berlin is [the new] Jerusalem… “and Israel shall not be happy  with the joys of the Nations” (משך חכמה ויקרא כו) (To provide context, the משך חכמה was written at the turn of the Twentieth Century in Europe, where many Jews were assimilating into German culture. To apply this to our days, one could substitute New York for Berlin.) As this processprogresses, the Jews become more dispersed and assimilated until the Jewish People are almost in danger of disappearing for good. At this time, G-d intervenes to fulfill His promise of \"ואף גם זאת,\" by causing trouble in the new host land (Anti-Semitism, pogroms, etc.) to save us from ourselves, to force us out in order to ensure the continuation of עם ישראל. This is the message of the tochacha - that as long as our nation is in the Diaspora, this cycle will continue and continue as a punishment for our ancestors' sins. While this does very accurately portray Jewish history for the past two millennia, and it definitely does paint a scary picture for the future, there is something missing from the Meshech Chachma that is hinted to in the pesukim and is very much present in our times- תשובה, return. In our parsha , after describing the five terrible admonitions, the passuk describes what will happen when the Jews inevitably realize their mistakes: וְהִתְוַדּוּ אֶת-עֲו‍ֹנָם וְאֶת-עֲו‍ֹן אֲבֹתָם, בְּמַעֲלָם אֲשֶׁר מָעֲלוּ-בִי, וְאַף, אֲשֶׁר-הָלְכוּ עִמִּי בְּקֶרִי. And they will confess their sins and the sins of their forefathers, in the treachery they committed against Me, and also because they have treated me too casually (כו:מ) But, G-d will not accept their vidduy : אַף-אֲנִי, אֵלֵךְ עִמָּם בְּקֶרִי, וְהֵבֵאתִי אֹתָם, בְּאֶרֶץ אֹיְבֵיהֶם I too will treat them with casualness, and I will bring them to the land of their enemies (מא) Wait… the whole point of the tochacha is to warn us of the price of abusing our relationship with G-d. Shouldn't He be happy that the Jews, after suffering five rounds of serious punishments, would admit that they did something wrong? Chizkuni answers: אף אני אלך עמם בקרי - אע\"פ שהתודו את עונם מאחר שאינם נכנעים וחוזרים I too will treat them with casualness - even though they confessed their sins, G-d will wait because they haven't yet given in and returned (חזקוני שם) Even though the Jewish People will have realized that they made a mistake, and will even go as far as apologizing to G-d for their iniquity, their apology is incomplete. How is it incomplete? Because they haven't returned yet to the land they were forced to leave in the first place. In order to stop the unfortunate cycle described in Meshech Chachma which is a punishment for treating G-d and His land with casualness, we need to do תשובה for both of these sins. Apologizing to Hashem will only help with our ancestors' transgressions against Him- in order to fix their transgression against Eretz Yisrael , we must return there and thereby remove ourselves from the Exile. Only then can we earn an end to the cycle of punishment, of G-d treating us with keri , and merit a fulfilment of \"וזכרתי להם ברית ראשונים... אשר הוצאתי אתם מארץ מצרים,\" which could very well involve us being redeemed the same way. Despite this subtle message having been read on a yearly basis for a very long time, until last century, it was impossible to do the latter, more literal type of teshuva . However, in our times, we have a chance to break the cycle, and to earn an end to G-d treating us with keri . It is no coincidence that the beginning of the passuk which immediately follows \"אף אני אלך עם בקרי,\" the first hopeful passuk in the tochacha equals 1940 (\"וזכרתי את בריתי יעקוב ואף\"). The decade of 1940 was a turning point for the Jewish People. In those ten years, we witnessed the end of the Jewish People in Eastern Europe, and the beginning of a new round of the Meshech Chachma 's cycle, as many Jews emigrated to the United States and began to grow the prominent communities there. But, even as that was going on, a new branch of Jewish History began, one which Rav Meir Simcha HaKohen could have never anticipated and even the pesukim barely mention- a chance for redemption, a chance to end our two thousand year tochacha and return to the bracha . With the founding of the State of Israel in 1948, at the end of the decade hinted to in our passuk , the Jewish People's existence has not been perfect. We've worked to revive the land that was cursed to become fallow, and we've rebuilt a culture where one used to be. Even though every step has been a battle, we've already begun to see a fulfilment of parts of the bracha - we've witnessed amazing rain in the past week alone, fulfilling the blessing of  \"  וְנָתַתִּי גִשְׁמֵיכֶם, בְּעִתָּם\" and enabling us to continue fulfilling \" וְנָתְנָה הָאָרֶץ יְבוּלָהּ, וְעֵץ הַשָּׂדֶה יִתֵּן פִּרְיו.\" The Israel Defense Forces have become so successful, powerful and able that we are truly seeing a fulfillment of \"  וְרָדְפוּ מִכֶּם חֲמִשָּׁה מֵאָה, וּמֵאָה מִכֶּם רְבָבָה יִרְדֹּפוּ; וְנָפְלוּ אֹיְבֵיכֶם לִפְנֵיכֶם, לֶחָרֶב\" in our days. And last, but definitely not least, G-d's shechina has returned to the Holy Land, fulfilling \" וְהִתְהַלַּכְתִּי, בְּתוֹכְכֶם, וְהָיִיתִי לָכֶם, לֵאלֹהִים; וְאַתֶּם, תִּהְיוּ-לִי לְעָם,\" and giving us a unique opportunity to make amends for our ancestors' sins of not respecting G-d properly. Even though we have come so far, we are not there yet. We have not yet merited the ultimate bracha of \"ונתתי שלום בארץ ושכבתם ואין מחריד,\" nor \"ונתתי משכני בתוככם ולא תגעל נפשי אתכם,\" and I believe this is because in our days of the אתחלתא דגאולה, we are halfway between tochacha and geulah . Even though we have recently reached huge milestone of having six million Jews dwelling in Israel,  the other 48% of global Jewry are still in the Diaspora. They are still in constant danger of the next stage of the tochacha and Meshech Chachma 's cycle, and whether they live in Ukraine, or France, or Spain, or even the United States, no country has ever remained safe for the Jews forever. In our days of the עקבתא דמשיחא, we are in a transition between tochacha and geulah . However, We now have a chance to make amends for our sins, permanently remove ourselves from the physical danger of the Exile, and earn the amazing brachot that come to the Jewish People who are truly following G-d's will - all we need to do if follow G-d's implicit call for teshuva , and return to the land that we were exiled from so long ago. If we do this, then , with Hashem's help, we will see an end to the tzarot of our brothers, a fulfillment of the first eleven pesukim of Bechokotai ,and the coming of the geulah , very very soon. share in social medias: Previous Update Next Update More Updates Where does Israel go from here?

Parashat Hashavua - The Weekly Portion - Behar JCT student Tzvi Silver on this week's parasha. 7.5.2014 BEHAR- FIGURING OUT FEASIBLE FEATS Tzvi Silver, a student in his second year of studies towards a degree in Electronics Engineering at JCT's Lev Campus, on this week's parasha For a week whose sedrah focuses on a few detailed laws of social culture and agriculture in Eretz Yisrael , it is not surprising that our haftarah involves buying land in the Holy Land. However, since the reading is from Sefer Yirmiyahu , the haftarah is not a simple story of a sale. It fits the theme of the Later Prophet's life in its ironic yet almost comical storyline. Yirmiyahu, imprisoned for his less than popular nevuot , is told by G-d to buy a piece of land from his cousin Chanamel . For what reason? Neither we nor Yirmiyahu know. The transaction takes place in the prison yard, the money changes hands and witnesses sign the contract and seal it. Then, the story takes its inevitable twist. Yirmiyahu is told by G-d to give the sealed deed of his newly acquired land to Baruch Ben Neriah, with very special instructions: וּנְתַתָּם בִּכְלִי חָרֶשׂ לְמַעַן יַעַמְדוּ יָמִים רַבִּים Y ou shall put them [both the contract and the land deed] in an earthenware utensil so that they will last a long time (ירמיהו לב:יד) And, finally, after this confusing scenario of land bought from jail only for its deed to be sealed for generations (not to mention the siege on Jerusalem), an explanation is finally given: כִּי כֹה אָמַר ה' צְבָאוֹת אלקי יִשְׂרָאֵל עוֹד יִקָּנוּ בָתִּים וְשָׂדוֹת וּכְרָמִים בָּאָרֶץ הַזֹּאת: For Hashem, the Lord, the G-d of the Jews, has said: [There will be a day] when houses and fields and vineyards will be bought in this land [Israel] . (שם טו) Powerful stuff. In the usual style of Sefer Yirmiyahu , the prophet's bizarre tasks end up being an extreme demonstration of an important message. Yes, Jerusalem may be surrounded by the Babylonians, and all hope may be lost. Yes, Yirmiyahu himself may be imprisoned for trying to help. But, there is hope. One day, the Jewish People will return and inherit the land and resettle and sell it to one another. ( Metzudat David explicitly relates both of these themes, by saying that one day, the Babylonians will be gone from the land, and who will still have a claim to property there? The imprisoned prophet who bought land and immediately sealed the deed in an ancient time capsule. That'll show them.) Yirmiyahu, however, is not 100% satisfied with the explanation. He prays to G-d, praising Him and asking why this whole process was necessary. He reminds and questions G-d: וְאַתָּה אָמַרְתָּ אֵלַי, אֲדֹנָי ה', קְנֵה-לְךָ הַשָּׂדֶה בַּכֶּסֶף, וְהָעֵד עֵדִים; וְהָעִיר נִתְּנָה, בְּיַד הַכַּשְׂדִּים Yet, you said, O Lord G-d, buy yourself a field with this money, and call witnesses… but the city is about the fall to the Kasdim . (שם כה) G-d gives a relatively long answer, including a history of the Jewish People's behavior and sins in Eretz Yisrael . Most of this is not included in our haftarah - only the first passuk is read: וַיְהִי, דְּבַר-ה', אֶל-יִרְמְיָהוּ, לֵאמֹר. הִנֵּה אֲנִי ה', אֱלֹקֵי כָּל-בָּשָׂר--הֲמִמֶּנִּי, יִפָּלֵא כָּל-דָּבָר. Then the word of G-d came to Yirmiyahu saying: Behold! I am the Lord, G-d of all beings- is there anything that I cannot do?! (שם כו-כז) Thus ends the haftarah of Parshat Behar - with an rhetorical question. One could even say that this statement isn't much of an answer to Yirmiyahu's prayer/question. However, Metzudat David explains that the last four words of our haftarah say everything about G-d's might and His ability to redeem us: הממני - ר\"ל ואם אמנם אני אלהי העולם וכי יהיה שום דבר שיהיה מכוסה ממני לבל אוכל עשוהו וכאומר אף שהארץ ניתנה ביד הכשדים מ\"מ בידי להחזירה לישראל ולזה צויתי לך לקנות השדה שיהיה לאות ולרמז שכן אעשה וכאשר יאמר בענין: From Me - [meaning:] if I am truly Hashem the G-d of the world and there is nothing hidden from me… Even if the land is given to the Kasdim, it is nevertheless within my ability to return it to the Jews, and this is why I commanded you (Yirmiyahu) to buy the field- as a sign and hint that I will return the land to you… (מצודת דוד שם) In other words, G-d's strength is a testament to the fact that just as He temporarily removed the Jewish People from the land, He could just as easily return them. Yirmiyahu's unfortunately timed purchase is a symbol of that, for why would he bother to buy land with all of this pomp and circumstance, just to have it overrun by the Chaldeans. Clearly, there was another reason- to show that some day, the Jewish People will return to Eretz Yisrael, and the land will once again have value. I would like expound on this with a small blast from the past. For those who were extra attentive in their first grade Chumash class, the phrase \"הממני יפלא כל דבר\" should sound super-familiar, because the first time that anything remotely resembling that appears in Tanach is at the beginning of פרשת וירא. When Avraham and Sarah are informed that they will be having a baby at their elderly age, Sarah begins to chuckle. Then G-d directly responds to Avraham: \"היפלא מה' דבר- Is anything beyond Hashem ?!\" And, lo and behold, Yitzchak was born less than a year later. The message from these two \"היפלא\"'s is clear- even when all hope is lost, whether it be Avraham and Sarah's hope to have a baby, or the Jewish People's hope of repelling the Kasdim , we just need to ask ourselves one thing: \"Is it really beyond G-d to save us?\" Even though G-d's response to Yirmiyahu's \"היפלא\" is a little bit longer in the coming than Avraham's, we are beginning to see signs of the Geulah . The Jewish People have been living en masse in Eretz Yisrael for over 120 years, and have been governing ourselves for 66. We have truly begun to see a fulfillment of Yirmiyahu's prophecy of \"עוד יקנו בתים ושדות וכרמים בארץ הזאת\" with Israel's real estate market not only booming, but becoming one of the most expensive ones in the world. Even though we have not yet merited the coming of the Mashiach , nor the rebuilding of the Bet Hamikdash , there can be no doubt that we've reached new national highs and אחרית הימים is nigh. Many among us question if the State of Israel is the answer to two thousand years of tefilot , if a secular government has the ability to  become the geulah . To them, I answer with the same words that G-d answered both Avraham Avinu and Yirmiyahu when all hope seemed lost: \"היפלא מה' דבר\"- Is it beyond Hashem, our G-d who caused a 99-year-old woman to have a baby, who returned us to Eretz Yisrael twice already, to accomplish this feat?

Haredi Hesder Program opens at JCT Read Jpost's article here! Haredi Hesder Program opens at JCT Haredi Yeshiva Opens at JCT, includes Two Years of Service in IDF's Cyber Defense Unit The first hesder yeshiva for haredi (ultra-Orthodox men) has recently received approval from the Defense Ministry and is now up and running, with 16 students having embarked on a four-year course of Torah study and military service. The hesder program is designed overwhelmingly for men from the national-religious sector and combines 17 months of military service with three-and-a-half years of yeshiva study, although the course for ultra-Orthodox recruits is different in composition from the regular hesder program. The course will be run by the Derech Haim Yeshiva, which is based at the campus of the Jerusalem College of Technology, known as Machon Lev. Unlike regular hesder service, participants in the Derech Haim program will serve for 24 months in the IDF. The Defense Ministry gave its final approval for the yeshiva to be recognized as a hesder institution last week. The first stage of the course, according to the program directors, will comprise a high standard of religious studies in the mornings and afternoons for a two-year period, which will focus on the acquisition of a deep practical understanding of Jewish law. During this phase, students will attend classes about defense in the evenings provided by Machon Lev and developed by the Cyber Defense Unit of the IDF, providing approximately one thousand hours of study over the two-year period. Recruits will then embark on their two-year period of military service in the army's Cyber Defense Unit, although they will not live on an IDF base and will be able to remain in their college residences, similar to soldiers filling other non-combat positions in the military. They will therefore be able to return to their religious studies in the evenings, while the other aspects of their military service will be conducted so as to allow the recruits to maintain their haredi way of life. These factors were critical in giving the program legitimacy and credibility for possible recruits from the mainstream haredi community. It is hoped that once the soldiers complete the fouryear course they will have acquired the necessary tools for integrating into the workforce. The field of cyber defense in which they will specialize will give them a high level of employability in today's job market, it is hoped. Of the 16 haredi men who have begun the course, the majority are born to parents who immigrated from the English-speaking countries and who have attended haredi high schools, whose students obtain the Israeli highschool diploma, something which most haredi educational institutions for highschool children do not do. There are, however, participants in the hesder course from more mainstream haredi junior yeshivot. The recruits from these institutions required remedial courses in core subjects such as math and English in order to obtain the required level for the academic courses. Registration is open for the next academic year and the yeshiva hopes to take 15 to 25 recruits. Rabbi Karmi Gross, originally from the US, was one of the leading figures behind the initiative, and wanted to provide an avenue for highly motivated young men from the haredi community to both do military service and engage in rigorous religious studies study. \"We see ourselves as a bridge to allow men from the haredi world who want something different to learn Torah and serve the country at the same time,\" Gross told The Jerusalem Post. \"We believe there are two ideals; one is sitting and studying Torah and the other is working and learning whenever you can, and both of these are desirable. Showing the beauty of Torah is a sanctification of God's name and for haredim to go out and contribute towards society can help achieve this.\" Yesh Atid MK Rabbi Dov Lipman, who has been involved in helping navigate the approval process for the course with the Defense Ministry and the army, praised the program as a model for the haredi community to embrace for enabling ongoing Torah study and the preservation of a haredi lifestyle, while fulfilling the requirements for military service. \"This [program] enables boys to be in yeshiva for four years while also fulfilling their service and learning the skills necessary to enter the work force when they finish their service and yeshiva years,\" said Lipman. \"I want to praise the defense minister who did not hesitate to grant hesder status to Derech Haim and I praise Rabbi Gross for taking the initiative and the hard work he has put in to make this dream become a reality.\" Click here to view the article on the Jerusalem Post website share in social medias: Previous Update Next Update More Updates Where does Israel go from here?

Parashat Hashavua - The Weekly Portion - EMOR/YOM HA'ATZMA'UT Home Page News and Updates ... Parashat Hashavua - The Weekly Portion - EMOR/YOM HA'ATZMA'UT JCT student Tzvi Silver on this week's parasha. 4.5.2014 EMOR/YOM HA'ATZMA'UT- THE SANCTITY OF MODERN MO'ADIM Tzvi Silver, a student in his second year of studies towards a degree in Electronics Engineering at JCT's Lev Campus, on this week's parasha In the midst of a parsha focused on the physical guidelines and standards for kohanim , the fourth aliyah changes topics a little bit, tangentially discussing the holidays of our people, the first time in the entire Torah that they are all listed together (and the first appearance of all of them, except for Pesach ). The section opens: וַיְדַבֵּר ה', אֶל-מֹשֶׁה לֵּאמֹר. דַּבֵּר אֶל-בְּנֵי יִשְׂרָאֵל, וְאָמַרְתָּ אֲלֵהֶם, מוֹעֲדֵי ה', אֲשֶׁר-תִּקְרְאוּ אֹתָם מִקְרָאֵי קֹדֶשׁ--אֵלֶּה הֵם, מוֹעֲדָי. And G-d spoke to Moshe saying: Speak to the Children of Israel, and say to them; the holidays of G-d, that you will call them holy, these are My holidays. (ויקרא כג:א-ב) After a very brief mention of שבת, the section continues to list our holidays, starting with the seemingly contradicting passuk : אֵלֶּה מוֹעֲדֵי ה', מִקְרָאֵי קֹדֶשׁ, אֲשֶׁר-תִּקְרְאוּ אֹתָם, בְּמוֹעֲדָם. These are the holidays of G-d, that are called holy, that you will call them in their set time (שם ד) These pesukim do not seem particularly copacetic. First, Moshe is told that G-d's holy days are the ones that the Jewish People will make holy (\"אשר תקראו אותם מקראי קודש, אלה הם מועדי\"). Then, we are given a laundry list of our chagim , Jewish Holidays for Dummies , if you would.  Which one is it? Rashi, based on the Midrash Sifra , answers that the first passuk has no actual ramifications in practical Halacha . Rather, it's more of a philosophical statement into our relationship with G-d. Hashem, as the בורא עולם, has control over the world- He causes the sun and moon to rise and orbit, and through this controls the seasons, the מועדים. But, we have control over how and when we celebrate the מועדים. G-d sends the New Moon, but the Bet Din must declare a new month for this to take effect with the Jewish People. In essence, the chagim symbolize the partnership between us and our Creator- He makes the מועדים, but we set them to be מקראי קודש. By saying \"אשר תקראו אותם מקראי קודש,\" G-d, through Moshe, is reminding us of the importance of our part in our relationship with G-d, for, despite His lunar signs, the holidays cannot exist without us declaring them. While this is a very touching thought which should give us a good feeling scarcely two weeks after we just \"sealed\" this partnership again by celebrating פסח, I never feel great disregarding the literal implications of an entire passuk , so I would instead like to present a more pshat -oriented answer to our question: It is very common in the Torah's style for a section to open with an introduction, a header to catch our attention before we begin to delve into the details. What is less common, but still known to happen, is where an introductory passuk is not just an introduction, but much more than that- a lesson, or disclaimer, before teaching a lesson. According to Ramban, this is exactly what the seemingly superfluous opening verse of last week's parsha , \"קדושים תהיו,\" does- it serves as a lesson that even if one follows all of the guidelines of Parshat Kedoshim , they will not be \"קדושים תהיו\" until they go לפנים משורת הדין. Even though it looks like, feels like, and tastes like an introduction to the following sections, ויקרא יט:ב  is much more than that- it is a disclaimer, a reminder that the idea of קדושה is not limited to the following section. I believe that here too, in the section of \"מועדי ה',\" the introductory passuk may well be a disclaimer, especially considering that there is another introduction scarcely two verses later. ויקרא כג seems to be a \"Cliffnotes\" on the major highlights of the Jewish calendar- \"אלה מועדי השם אשר תקראו אתם במועדם,\" these are the holidays of the Jewish calendar that you will call holy . But, that's not all! We as a nation believe in the philosophy of תורת חיים, and that, with time, minor adjustments and additions need to be made to our religious observance. This is what I believe the first passuk \"מועדי ה' אשר תקראו אתם מקראי קדש, אלה הם מעדי\" signifies- it gives us the ability to add holidays in the future for exceptional miracles, such as Chanukah and Purim (which were definitely not mentioned in פרשת אמור). It is the \"escape clause\" from the seeming exclusivity of \"אלה מועדי ה'.\" This idea can help explain a difficulty with this week's haftara , which is read from ספר יחקאל. The choice of יחזקאל מ\"ד as the haftarah for our parsha seems pretty straightforward- in a prophecy to Yechezkel, G-d outlines the physical laws for Kohanim in the Third Bet Hamikdash that very much parallel the ones found in our parsha . However, there are a few key differences between the guidelines, which mainly reflect a stricter standard being set for the future Temple than the Tabernacle. The commentators grapple to explain these inconsistencies, with two distinct approaches emerging: Rashi, using his oft-prefered drash methodology, teaches that, like many nevuot in ספר יחזקאל, this reading cannot be taken literally. Since the guidelines of Parshat Emor were in effect for the Mishkan and the first two Temples, why should they change for the third one? Rashi then continues to write off almost every inconsistency in יחזקאל, citing midrash-based teachings. Radak, on the other hand, manages to incorporate both sets of \"תורת כוהנים\" by using the same principle we showed above in the context of the מועדים; the idea of תורת חיים. When the mitzvot of פרשת אמור were given to the Jewish People, they had a very specific audience in mind- a group of כהנים who had grown up in the desert, and were on a lower level. For them, these standards were more than enough to ensure their holiness in the Tabernacle and in the earlier Temples. But, for the audience יחזקאל's נבואה was presented to, those Kohanim of ימות המשיח who will have recovered the zechut of doing temple service unpracticed for over two thousand years- their increased holiness will require higher standards of kedusha , such as those exemplified in יחזקאל מ\"ד. Thus, there is no contradiction between the two sets of laws of the Kohanim . Plus, we've once again exemplified the importance of תורת חיים, and the all-too-relevant concept that sometimes, especially close to ימות המשיח, additions can be made to our religion to compensate for changes in the outside world. Jumping forward to our times, we will this week be celebrating a day unique to the Jewish calendar in its split observance. To half of the Jewish world, 5 Iyar is a celebration, of victory and independence, and of return to our national homeland. To the other half, 5 Iyar is a day of mourning, for the same reasons. Many of the latter like to question how we can add a holiday to the Jewish calendar for the modern occasion of the Jewish State's declaration of independence. They question how leading rabbinical figures of that time could dare institute this celebration, especially one which involves saying Hallel with a beracha , when it is clear from Parshat Emor  that our list of מועדים is already complete.  To them I remind that the \"introductory passuk\" of פרשת המועדים clearly says \"אשר תקראו אותם מקראי קדש, אלו הם מועדי\"- if we acknowledge the significance of the establishment of the first Jewish government in modern history (as virtually all accepted poskim did at that time, to some degree), and we establish a holiday in commemoration of this momentous date, then not only is it a modern Jewish holiday, but it's also considered one of מועדי ה' and is definitely kadosh . Furthermore, the Jewish People are in a different place now than we were in the desert thousands of years ago- just as in Sefer Yechezkel, additions were made to the halachot of the Kohanim in אחרית הימים, in our times, which we believe to be approaching those hallowed days, we too need to make additions to show the significance of special days like 5 Iyar. We have the choice to make days holy, and on Monday evening, it behooves each and every one of us to give יום העצמאות its due glory, because, even if many have not personally decided whether the State of Israel is good for them or not, the gedolei yisrael of 5708 made a clear statement about ה' אייר- that it is among the מועדי השם, and it is indeed holy. With this is mind, let us all give proper kavod to the celebration of the sixty-sixth year of the אתחלתא דגאולה on Monday evening. share in social medias: Previous Update Next Update More Updates Where does Israel go from here?

Preparing Ethiopian Israelies for Professional Careers Israel 21c on JCT's Education for Ethiopians program 28.4.2014 Advancing Israeli-Ethiopians The first program for this [the Israeli-Ethiopian] population began in 1998 at the Jerusalem College of Technology (JCT), where students complete dual academic and Judaic courses of study. “Education for Ethiopians” prepares participants for careers in fields such as engineering, computer science, biotech and nursing on JCT’s separate campuses for men and women. Stuart Hershkowitz, senior adviser to the JCT president, tells ISRAEL21c that 64 women and 74 men are currently enrolled, and mainstreamed into the general student body. About 90 percent must first complete a year-long prep course. With the help of several foundations, the Jewish Agency and the government, JCT provides them free tuition and board, free tutoring, bus fare to go home on weekends (few live in Jerusalem) and twice monthly get-togethers. A dedicated counselor, Adi Yones, helps them navigate the unfamiliar academic and social landscape. “Adi is a graduate of the program’s first years and is like a big brother to the students,” says Hershkowitz. “As a result, we have an extremely low dropout rate. And our graduates have a 100% placement record in their chosen professions, which is unusual. They’re very serious students.” A large percentage of the men in the program have also been selected for Atuda, the Israel Defense Forces’ Academic Reserve, which allows them to complete their degree prior to active service utilizing the skills gained in college. “This has nothing to do with affirmative action,” Hershkowitz stresses. “There are no breaks for Ethiopians at all. They have to earn Atuda like anyone else, and that is amazing since most are coming from a non-academic family background.” Yones tells ISRAEL21c that many of the men and women he counsels were raised in great hardship, yet they excel when given proper support. “The program has changed a lot of lives,” he says. One young man tried five times to get into Atuda and was finally successful after taking the JCT prep course. He ended up switching from computer science to a more demanding major in engineering. Others have found their niche in aerodynamics, physics or electro-optics. “Even students with a lot of potential cannot do well if they have the worries of putting food on the table,” Yones says. “The financial, social and academic support makes all the difference.” This article originally appearled on the Israel 21c website.

Parashat Hashavua - The Weekly Portion - Acharei Mot/ Hagadol Home Page News and Updates ... Parashat Hashavua - The Weekly Portion - Acharei Mot/ Hagadol JCT student Tzvi Silver on this week's parasha. 5.8.2015 ACHAREI MOT/HAGADOL- RECIPROCATED RELIANCE: Putting Ani Hashem Elokeichem First Tzvi Silver, a student in his third year of studies towards a degree in Electronics Engineering at JCT's Lev Campus, on this week's parasha Our parsha , aside from discussing the Yom Kippur service in the Temple, also includes פרשת עריות, which discusses all of the forbidden relationships in Judaism. The section opens: וַיְדַבֵּר ה', אֶל-מֹשֶׁה לֵּאמֹר. דַּבֵּר אֶל-בְּנֵי יִשְׂרָאֵל, וְאָמַרְתָּ אֲלֵהֶם:  אֲנִי, ה' אֱלֹקֵיכֶם. כְּמַעֲשֵׂה אֶרֶץ-מִצְרַיִם אֲשֶׁר יְשַׁבְתֶּם-בָּהּ, לֹא תַעֲשׂוּ; וּכְמַעֲשֵׂה אֶרֶץ-כְּנַעַן אֲשֶׁר אֲנִי מֵבִיא אֶתְכֶם שָׁמָּה, לֹא תַעֲשׂוּ, וּבְחֻקֹּתֵיהֶם, לֹא תֵלֵכוּ. אֶת-מִשְׁפָּטַי תַּעֲשׂוּ וְאֶת-חֻקֹּתַי תִּשְׁמְרוּ, לָלֶכֶת בָּהֶם:  אֲנִי, ה' אֱלֹקֵיכֶם. And G-d spoke to Moshe saying: Speak to all of the Jewish people, and tell them: I am G-d. Do not act like those in Egypt, where you lived, and do not act like those in Canaan where I am bringing you, and do not follow their laws. You shall follow my laws and keep my rules to follow them, I am G-d. (ויקרא יח: א-ד) What a strange opening to such an important section. On a textual level, there are several unusual nuances. First, we are told the superfluous statement \"I am G-d.\" Then, G-d tells us specifically not to follow the laws of Egypt or Canaan, then the more general \"their laws.\" Finally, the introduction closes with another unnecessary \"I am G-d,\" hinting that there may be something deeper to these verses than meets the eyes. Aside from these nuances, the third passuk begs a more obvious question. If Canaan is such a hotbed of corruption and immorality that it is being compared to Egypt, why would G-d take the Jewish people out of Egypt in the first place? Wouldn't it be safer to remain enslaved to a nation whose foreign culture has become more known to the Jews over time, than to move someplace new and face unprecedented threats to their עבודת השם? While many commentators address some of our more basic textual questions, I would like to present an approach which will not only address these, but will also answer our bigger question of why G-d took us out of Egypt: Scripture has made it very clear that in the times of our forefathers, the world was not a very moral place. Avraham set a new standard for morality when he accepted monotheism- he was called אברהם העברי for this very reason, for he stood on the \"other side\" from all of those around him, and guarded himself from sin. Moral scruples were unfortunately at a absolute low. Ramban explains that Egypt was well-known as the global center for עבודה זרה, while the Canaanites were even worse, for their allure was in עריות. Despite this, G-d freed the Jews from slavery and led them to ארץ כנען. Why would He put them in this bad situation? I believe that the answer lies in faith. Every day, we wake up and express our thanks to G-d for allowing us to return to the world, then we express our faith in G-d. But faith is a two-way road, and while our faith in G-d may have saved our nation from catastrophe many times, the truth is that every time, we were only saved because of G-d's faith in us. Just as we believe in His ability to guide us, save us, and redeem us, He believes in our ability to do the right thing- to follow His commandments and not stray from His path. In taking the Jews out of the idolatrous Egypt and brining them to the immoral Canaan, G-d was expressing His faith in us- His belief that our forebears could change the culture of Canaan. That their כיבוש הארץ would not only destroy the seven Canaanite nations, but also their evil culture. This could explain the seemingly unnecessary \"ובחוקתיהם לא תלכו\"- yes, the Jewish people shouldn't follow the ways of the Land of Canaan, but only while these ways are \"חוקותיהם- their laws .\" As soon as the land is conquered and under Jewish control, this would no longer be \"חוקותיהם,\" but rather \"משפתי\" and \"חקתי\"- My (G-d's) laws , which, as we see above, are directly connected to \"אני ה' אלקיכם.\" In essence, G-d took us out of Egypt to a place that at that time was not much better than where they left, because of His faith in our ability to make the right changes and fix the societal wrongs of our Promised Land. I would like to take this a step further by attempting to answer why our פסוקים are book-ended by \"אני ה' אלקיכם.\" Back in the times of יציאת מצרים, the Jews were faced with a dilemma. They had seen time and time again that G-d was with Moshe in the signs and miracles that were performed. But, with the thought of leaving one morally corrupt place for another, many Jews may have questioned why their destination was ארץ כנען. Many may have even said that they were better off in a land of עובדי עבודה זרה, which, over the centuries spent there, they had gotten used to, than in the frightening new land of עריות, which could cause their brothers to sin. But, there is a famous gemara (כתובות יג:ב), which makes everything all too clear: שכל הדר בארץ ישראל דומה כמי שיש לו אלוה, וכל הדר בחוצה לארץ דומה כמי שאין לו אלוה שנאמר (ויקרא כה) לתת לכם את ארץ כנען להיות לכם לאלהים For anyone who lives in Eretz Yisrael is like he has a G-d, and anyone who lives outside of Israel is as if he has no G-d, for it says \"To give you Eretz Canaan, to be a G-d for you\"… Those who would remain in physical שעבוד (living outside of Israel, not to mention enslavement), to avoid a perceived spiritual שאבוד, are as much an עובד עבודה זרה as the gentiles around them. This could explain the beacon of the seemingly superfluous \"אני ה' אלקיכם\" in our pesukim- before worrying about the morality of ארץ כנען (in the following פרשת העריות), the Jews are advised to first make sure that they are serving G-d properly, which, according to our interpretation above, means worrying about following G-d to Eretz Yisrael first, then afterwards, worrying about the moral standards there. [I would also remind my readers of the famous passage from ספר הכוזרי quoted here , which teaches that even if ארץ ישראל becomes full of זמה, Jews have an obligation to live there, and the זכות of their מסירות נפש will lead to תשובה] At the end of the day, though, this approach returns to the two-way road of faith. G-d has faith in the Jewish People- He believes and knows that we will do the right thing, for, as דוד המלך wrote: \"לב טהור ברא לי ורוח נכון חדש בקרבי.\" We just need to have faith in G-d that even though things do not always seem to be 100% Kosher, He is leading us in the correct direction, and will listen to our prayers for purity. Furthermore, we need to mirror His faith in ourselves, so that when we will never again question whether we can trust our brothers with our physical, spiritual, and moral interests. Only if we extend ourselves to have faith in G-d and in ourselves have we fulfilled the implicit command in פרשת אחרי מות of \"אני ה' אלקיכם.\" This week, we will be celebrating שבת הגדול. While the Shabbat before Pesach is always great (whether one will be eating take-out Chinese or freezer leftovers), in this case, הגדול is alluding to two aspects of that day: the big מסירות נפש that עם ישראל made by taking sheep, the Egyptian god, in broad daylight, and the big miracle that G-d did by ensuring that the Egyptians would not stop them. While these may seem like two different greatnesses, I believe that, based on our interpretation above, they are one and the same. By taking the huge risk of taking sheep for a קרבן, the Jewish People were expressing their faith in G-d's ability to protect them and save them, and G-d's great miracle was a reciprocation in the form of His faith that they would execute the מצוה properly. In the special הפטרה for this great shabbat, read from the last פרק of נביאים, this theme of \"אני ה' אלקיכם\" continues: כִּי אֲנִי ה', לֹא שָׁנִיתִי; וְאַתֶּם בְּנֵי-יַעֲקֹב, לֹא כְלִיתֶם. לְמִימֵי אֲבֹתֵיכֶם סַרְתֶּם מֵחֻקַּי, וְלֹא שְׁמַרְתֶּם--שׁוּבוּ אֵלַי וְאָשׁוּבָה אֲלֵיכֶם, אָמַר ה' צְבָאוֹת; וַאֲמַרְתֶּם, בַּמֶּה נָשׁוּב For I am G-d and I have not changed, and you, children of Yaakov, have not been destroyed. From the times of your forefathers you have strayed from my laws and did not keep them- return to me and I will return to you, said G-d, but you said 'for what do we need to return?'\" (מלאכי ג:ו-ז) G-d demands repentance- He has always been \"אני ה' אלקיכם,\" and has had enough faith in us to keep us alive, but we, as a nation have always sinned. While the language of \"שובו אלי\" usually means spiritual תשובה, in the context of our idea above and the reciprocated \"ואשובה אליכם,\" it is clear that the Jewish people's repeated sin is a lack of faith in ourselves. This עבירה is extremely dangerous because aside from the damage it does to relationships between Jews and to G-d, it also leaves one thinking that they are right, that they've done nothing wrong. All  they can say is \"במה נשוב?\" Why should we do תשובה? In the context of our פרשה, I would like to suggest that these pesukim are targeted specifically to Jews in our times who continue to live in חוץ לארץ because they believe it is more spiritually safe there. Their lack of מסירות נפש (and one could say based on the גמרא, lack of יראת שמים) is a terrible sin, but they believe they are doing the right thing, because they avoid the spiritual עריות that they associate with a secular Jewish government. They choose to live in physical שעבוד to avoid a possible spiritual שאבוד. But, as we’ve seen above, one who has very little faith in his fellow Jews and in G-d does not properly fulfill \"אני ה' אלקיכם\" which is specifically put in our פרשה before the actual עריות- in effect, their lack of faith to avoid sin has caused them to violate the first and second commandments with a very clear conscience. The remainder of the הפטרה goes further to say that they may even be part of the reason that our גאולה has been delayed so long. In order to ensure a speedy redemption, our exiled brothers need to regain their faith in the Jews of Israel and in G-d, and follow His call of \"שובו אלי- return to my Homeland.\" As we enter חג הגאולה on Monday night, we will retell the story of יציאת מצרים, of the faith of those who followed Moshe out of Egypt to heed G-d's call to return to His land. Later on in the evening, after a good meal, the subject matter will switch to the future- we will daven for the גאולה and beg G-d for the coming of אליהו הנביא. But, our הפטרה makes it very clear when he will come: זִכְרוּ, תּוֹרַת מֹשֶׁה עַבְדִּי, אֲשֶׁר צִוִּיתִי אוֹתוֹ בְחֹרֵב עַל-כָּל-יִשְׂרָאֵל, חֻקִּים וּמִשְׁפָּטִים. הִנֵּה אָנֹכִי שֹׁלֵחַ לָכֶם, אֵת אֵלִיָּה הַנָּבִיא--לִפְנֵי, בּוֹא יוֹם ה', הַגָּדוֹל, וְהַנּוֹרָא.  וְהֵשִׁיב לֵב-אָבוֹת עַל-בָּנִים, וְלֵב בָּנִים עַל-אֲבוֹתָם--פֶּן-אָבוֹא, וְהִכֵּיתִי אֶת-הָאָרֶץ חֵרֶם. If you follow משה's commandments- \"חוקי\" and \"משפטי\" (foremost among them, \"אנוכי ה' אלקיך\"), then you will merit אליהו הנביא. Eliyahu will come in a time before the \"יום ה' הגדול והנורא,\" and he will \"והשיב לב אבות על בנים\"- return the spirit (faith) of the fathers (in Egypt) on their children (in חו\"ל in our times). With Hashem's help, we will merit all of our Jewish brothers regaining the dual faith of our fathers, so that, we will bring the יום ה' הגדול והנורא very very soon, and merit to bring the קרבן פסח on Monday night in the rebuilt and redeemed ירושלים עיר הקודש. share in social medias: Previous Update Next Update More Updates Where does Israel go from here?

Parashat Hashavua - The Weekly Portion - Tazria JCT student Tzvi Silver on this week's parasha. 9.4.2014 THE BIRTH OF A REDEMPTION Tzvi Silver, a student in his second year of studies towards a degree in Electronics Engineering at JCT's Lev Campus, on this week's parasha Continuing on the topic of טומאה and טהרה from last week, our פרשה shifts from the laws relating to animals to those for humans. And, as Ibn Ezra writes, what better place to start than with childbirth, one of the happiest and most beautiful parts of any couple's life, when they partner with G-d to create another human being: וַיְדַבֵּר ה'  אֶל מֹשֶׁה לֵּאמֹר: דַּבֵּר אֶל בְּנֵי יִשְׂרָאֵל לֵאמֹר אִשָּׁה כִּי תַזְרִיעַ וְיָלְדָה זָכָר וְטָמְאָה שִׁבְעַת יָמִים כִּימֵי נִדַּת דְּוֹתָהּ תִּטְמָא... וּשְׁלֹשִׁים יוֹם וּשְׁלֹשֶׁת יָמִים תֵּשֵׁב בִּדְמֵי טָהֳרָה בְּכָל קֹדֶשׁ לֹא תִגָּע וְאֶל הַמִּקְדָּשׁ לֹא תָבֹא עַד מְלֹאת יְמֵי טָהֳרָהּ: Hashem spoke to Moshe and Aharon saying: Speak to the children of Israel saying; when a woman gives birth and has a son, she will be impure for seven days like her days of nidah… [Afterwards,] thirty days she sall sit in bloods of purity- she cannot touch any kodashim, nor can she enter the Temple, until she finishes her days of [recovering] purity . (ויקרא יב) This seems just a little bit confusing. This woman had just completed one of the holiest experiences of her life, the terrible pain, followed by tremendous joy, of bringing another soul into the world. Why would she have to sit on the side as ritually impure after this? Rabbi Lord Jonathan Sacks, former chief Rabbi of the United Kingdom has a very philosophical answer to our quandary, one which I present below as I could not do it justice by summarizing: Clearly the Torah intends a message here, and it is unmistakable. To be a Jew is to know that survival is not a matter of biology alone. What other cultures may take as natural is for us a miracle. Every Jewish child is a gift of G-d. No faith has taken children more seriously or devoted more of its efforts to raising the next generation. Childbirth is wondrous. To be a parent is the closest any of us come to G-d himself. That, incidentally, is why women are closer to G-d than men, because they, unlike men, know what it is to bring new life out of themselves, as G-d brings life out of himself. The idea is beautifully captured in the verse in which, leaving Eden, Adam turns to his wife and calls her Chavah “for she is the mother of all life.\" We can now speculate about the laws relating to childbirth. When a mother gives birth, not only does she undergo great risk (until recently, childbirth was a life-threatening danger to mother and baby alike). She is also separated from what until now had been part of her own body (a foetus, said the rabbis, “is like a limb of the mother”) and which has now become an independent person. If that is so in the case of a boy, it is doubly so in the case of a girl – who, with G-d’s help, will not merely live but may herself in later years become a source of new life. At one level, therefore, the laws signal the detachment of life from life. At another level, they surely suggest something more profound. There is a halakhic principle: “One who is engaged in a mitzvah is exempt from other mitzvoth.” It is as if G-d were saying to the mother: for forty days in the case of a boy, and doubly so in the case of a girl (the mother-daughter bond is ontologically stronger than that between mother and son), I exempt you from coming before Me in the place of holiness because you are fully engaged in one of the holiest acts of all, nurturing and caring for your child. Unlike others you do not need to visit the Temple to be attached to life in all its sacred splendour. You are experiencing it yourself, directly and with every fibre of your being. Days, weeks, from now you will come and give thanks before Me (together with offerings for having come through a moment of danger). But for now, look upon your child with wonder. For you have been given a glimpse of the great secret, otherwise known only to G-d. Childbirth exempts the new mother from attendance at the Temple because her bedside replicates the experience of the Temple. She now knows what it is for love to beget life and in the midst of mortality to be touched by an intimation of immortality. [1] So, we see that the טומאה of the new mother is not a negative state. Rather, it shows that she is on such a high level that she does not need to go to the מקדש to feel connected to G-d- looking at her newborn baby, created in partnership with G-d, is all she needs. On a more broad level, the birth of the baby, while it may seem impure and far removed from anything sacred, is the most holy, for the miracles involved bring everyone closer to G-d in the process. This week, we have the rare opportunity of reading פרשת החודש  with our סדרה. The מפטיר is read from פרשת בא, when בני  ישראל are commanded in their firstמצוה  as a nation. Even though the bulk of the מצות are not given until הר סיני, this is considered by many to be one of the first stages of the birth of עם ישראל. The casual observer would object that this is a truly awful time to label as the birth of our nation, for, according to the מידרש, the Jewish People were on the forty-ninth (out of fifty) level of טומאה, and were almost beyond redeeming. Why not call מעמד הר סיני, where our ancestors were on a much higher level, the genesis of our nation? I believe the answer lies in the essence of why a new mother is initially in a state of טומאה after having her baby. As Rabbi Sacks pointed out, theטומאה  of childbirth is not a negative, unholy thing- it is the most holy, because its miraculous nature leaves all more closely connected to G-d. So too by פרשת החודש, the Jewish people were definitely on a lower level than, say, הר סיני, but for the past months, they had been exposed to open miracles from G-d, the \"שמי י-ה-ו-ה\" (which, Rav Yehuda Halevi explains on פרשת וארא, represents G-d's nature of defying nature) that He had withheld for so many generations (including for the אבות). Theirטומאה may have started from being exposed to a culture of idolatry for hundreds of years, but, in witnessing G-d's miracles and acquiescing to His commandments of \"החודש הזה\" and bringing the first קרבן פסח, theirטומאה  switched to become a positive type. Or, in other words, their \"דמי טמאה\" effectively turned to \"דמי טהורה,\" much as a new mother does very soon after giving birth. It is for this reason that we can, with confidence, attribute our nation's birth to פרשת החודש, the very beginning of גאולת מצרים. This lesson is extremely relevant to our times as well. Since 1948, with the establishment of the State of Israel, we, the Jewish People dwelling in lands with levels of morality almost analogous to Egypt, have known that the גאולה was imminent. The question raised by many, however, is how could the final redemption come through a secular government, one which is sometimes perceived as \"טמא\" through its policies and leadership? But, as we see from both our sedra and our parsha, anything truly holy begins in a state of unholiness. The גאולה is like this- yes, it may start out in a secular government, one which many learned people call \"טמא\", but they misunderstand what this means. Yes it's טמא, but not like the initial seven days of דמי טמאה that a mother experiences, but rather דמי טהרה. It's the טומאה of a nation whose short history is scattered with open miracles, whose very existence and survival is a testament to G-d's strength, much like a new baby. The birth of the גאולה was never meant to be illustrious. The bloodline of the משיח is quite the opposite, beginning in the incestuous union of Lot and his eldest daughter, continuing to the unconventional marriage of Boaz and Rut, and the illicit joining of David and Batsheva. But, as we've seen by the birth of a baby in our סדרה, and the birth of עם ישראל in פרשת החודש, this means nothing, because the future of our אתחלתא דגאולה will be amazing, and it can and will demonstrate to the world that we are an אור לגוים. We just need to have faith in it its growth, just as parents trust that their baby will grow to become more than an infant. And, of course, we need to help get it started. Parshat Tazria has 67 pesukim , which Chazal equate to the acronym בני\"ה, her children , very appropriate for our פרשה. However,בניה can also mean the commanding verb build her . The message here is very clear- in order to help bring the משיח, symbolic of the birth of בניה,we must follow the call of בניה, and return to settle and rebuild her, our eternal homeland. Faith in the State of Israel is not enough now- in order to rebuild, we must substantiate our אמונה with action and join the ranks of the more than six million Jews who have reclaimed our ancestral homeland. As חג הגאולה approaches, if each and every one of us can make a conscious effort towards joining עם ישראל in her newborn גאולה, then, with Hashem's help, we will merit the final rebuilding of Jerusalem and the Third Bet Hamikdash , very very soon.

Will their credits be accepted? As an institution recognized by the Council for Higher Education in Israel, JCT’s credits are generally accepted worldwide and students from the program have seamlessly transferred to other institutions around the world. However students should check with specific colleges as each has different requirements for transfer credits. Questions? Why we Changed our Name Home Page News and Updates ... Why we Changed our Name Prof. Chaim Sukenik talks to JPost's Judy Siegel- Itzkovich about changing JCT's name to Jerusalem College of Technology - Lev Academic Center, and discusses his plans for the future of the institution. 03/01/2014 The Jerusalem College of Technology-Lev Academic Center is changing along with the evolution of Israeli demographics. In 1969, the visionary, Vienna-born religious physicist Dr. William Low assembled seven young men in an apartment in the capital’s Bayit Vagan neighborhood to combine engineering and yeshiva studies. As this was probably the last thing on the minds of modern Orthodox young men two years after the Six Day War, the educator/scientist later known as Prof. Ze’ev Lev dreamed what then seemed impossible – that the minuscule student body would grow to 400 or 500. Today, the flourishing college that has been known for decades as the Jerusalem College of Technology (JCT) – its main campus nestled between the Givat Mordechai and Bayit Vagan neighborhoods – has 4,500 students of engineering and related fields. The first JCT president achieved his dream before he died of a stroke in 2004 at the age of 82. Five more have served as JCT presidents – the late state comptroller, Prof. Yitzhak (Ernst) Nebenzahl; applied physicist Zvi Weinberger; electro-optics engineer Prof. Joseph Bodenheimer; leading theoretical mathematician Prof. Noah Dana-Picard; and the new president (since September), chemistry and nanotechnology Prof. Chaim Sukenik from Bar-Ilan University (BIU), who recently gave an extensive interview to The Jerusalem Post. Today, JCT’s student body is very diverse and different from that in the beginning. Half of JCT’s graduates are modern Orthodox – most of the men admitted after completing their full military service in the regular army or Hesder program. About 140 are modern Orthodox men studying for a four-year academic degree before doing about six years of service as officers in the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) in the Atuda Academit (academic military program). Busy 12 hours a day, they study Talmud and other Judaic subjects in the mornings in the Beit Midrash and secular studies in the afternoons and early evening. A third of the students, part of JCT’s Machon Naveh, are (mostly) married haredi men who never before learned English, sciences or anything more than basic arithmetic and spend a year or more in a JCT preparatory program before starting their academic studies. They have cultural challenges as well; in yeshiva, haredi men study just Talmud and are used to relative informality and no tests. In our preparatory courses, they face multiple subjects, a rigid schedule, formal exams and written reports. There is also a special preparatory curriculum for observant men of Ethiopian origin who have a lot of catching up to do. The married haredi students who spend only late afternoons to evenings on campus are exempt from learning in the Beit Midrash, because most have to support their families, or they prefer to study in ultra-Orthodox kollel yeshivot for married students. Potential employers have begun to notice that haredi graduates offer high-standard work ethics and productivity. ABOUT HALF of JCT’s students are women, most of them modern Orthodox, at the cramped, rented space in Machon Tal (Jerusalem’s Givat Shaul campus). They earn bachelor’s of science degrees in most of the hi-tech subjects taught to the men – electro- optical (but not electronic) and computer engineering, industrial management, technology marketing, accountancy and nursing, as well as graduate degrees in business administration. Other women attend Machon Tal’s highly respected nursing school where licensing test grades are the highest in the country. All JCT women are also required to learn Jewish studies as well. Another campus – Lustig in Ramat Gan – teaches haredi women mostly computer programming, while there are separate programs at Machon Tal called Da’at for Hebrew-speaking haredi women and a smaller one called Tvuna for (mostly) Yiddish- speaking women from the Mea She’arim quarter. “It’s easier to get haredi women into college than men; two-thirds of haredi students are female,” Sukenik explained. Many more of them matriculate than men, but women too generally have to go through preparatory and even pre-preparatory courses to raise their level of English, math and sciences. At Lustig, Da’at and Tnuva, the haredi women study computer science, management, accounting and software engineering. “Haredi women even developed applications for Windows 8 and smartphones,” Sukenik said with pride. JCT will in October launch an English-language bachelor’s degree program in business administration that it hopes will attract several dozen men – foreigners and new immigrants; and plans for a similar program in computer science have already been approved. If it is successful for men, the board will also consider a comparable program for women. With the rise in aliya from France, JCT’s French-speaking engineering programs have also expanded and will include students who have not yet immigrated but are seriously contemplating it; French-speaking rabbis teach in the Beit Midrash. Master’s degrees in business administration and computer communications have been available for several years to modern Orthodox and haredi men, and at the other end of the timeline, there is a live-in boy’s high school, many of whose graduates go on to study at Machon Lev. AROUND THE beginning of Sukenik’s fouryear term, JCT hired a company to investigate the level of name-recognition and other issues. “We are very well known to the national-religious community around the country and the world,” Sukenik said in wide-ranging interview with the Post. “But we learned that among secular employers of our graduates, the widely used nickname of Machon Lev [Lev Institute] is not known.” In fact, he continued, when a graduate names Machon Lev, potential employers who are secular – and even cab drivers – mistakenly believe it is the cardiology institute (“lev” means heart) of Shaare Zedek Medical Center, which is just down the road from JCT. As a result, the JCT board of governors decided to change the name, signs, publications and the stationery to JCT-Lev Academic Center in English and “Hamercaz Ha’akedemi Lev” in Hebrew; there is also a new logo that looks like an open book and is somewhat heart shaped. But graduates and the national-religious community will undoubtedly continue to call it Machon Lev among themselves. If that was not enough of a reason for confusion, just across the broad boulevard where JCT stands on a hill, another engineering college exists. The former campus where the Bezeq communications company that for many years trained its phone technicians became the Jerusalem College of Engineering in 1999. With a huge donation of $40 million from the Azrieli Foundation of shopping mall magnate David Azrieli, it was turned into the secular Azrieli College of Engineering Jerusalem. It is due to increase its student body – men and women studying together, a minority of them religiously observant – by 75 percent and is currently engaged in major construction and expansion. Although it offers some of the same engineering degrees – electronics, electro-optics, industrial management and computers, in addition to a first-ever degree in pharmaceutical engineering – Sukenik says he doesn’t regard the neighbor across the street as competition. “We are unique in being an engineering college with gender separation for religious reasons. In our DNA, we are national religious, but our separation of the sexes, for reasons of modesty, on different campuses allows us to attract the haredi communities as well,” said Sukenik. Preserving a special environment of gender separation, said the JCT president, nevertheless poses financial burdens. Some departments are small and thus not economically efficient. The handful of modern Orthodox women who study electro-optics engineering – not a very popular field among females – even get scholarships for pursuing such studies. Male lecturers may teach on both the men’s and women’s Jerusalem campuses, but women lecture only at Machon Tal, requiring a lot of running around. “The question is how well we can manage doubling up, with the same courses for men and women. We will certainly make more use of video conferencing to maintain high quality education standard.” Sukenik believes that “Internet technology will help us. There will be online courses to preserve the gender-separated environment, but live teaching assistants will be present in each classroom.” Yet in about five years, a separate women’s campus will open on 24 dunams (6 acres) of empty land at the bottom of the men’s main campus in Givat Mordechai. Donated by the Israel Lands Administration, the plot will house buildings completely separate from the men’s, and only male faculty members will be able pass through the gates in the two. THE SIXTH JCT president was born to educator parents and grew up in Miami, until they moved to Cleveland. Sukenik earned his bachelor’s degree in 1972 at New York’s Yeshiva College (also gender-separated at the undergraduate level) and his doctorate in organic chemistry at the California Institute of Technology. After a year as a National Science Foundation postdoctoral research fellow at the University of California at Los Angeles, he returned to Cleveland, where for 18 years he was a faculty member at Case Western Reserve University – ranked among America’s best research institutions and colleges. He and his English-teacher wife Rachelle married young, when he was 20, and they came on aliya in 1995. His mother, who is almost 90, also immigrated, at the age of 79. The couple, who have four married children – two of them Israeli – live in the Nof Ayalon community off the Jerusalem-Tel Aviv highway. Sukenik joined BIU’s chemistry department almost immediately and held the Steinberg chair in nanotechnology. His research group, which he continues to direct one day a week, focuses on inferfacial chemistry, with work extending from fundamental studies of self-assembled thin films to the creation of nano-scale organic and inorganic coatings. These have many applications – including the protection of materials for aerospace applications, prevention of biological fouling on surfaces for medical equipment and water bonding for photonic and microelectronic applications. At BIU, Sukenik founded the Institute for Nanotechnology and Advanced Materials at BIU and headed the university’s Minerva Center for Micro-scale and Nano-scale Particles and Films. “We integrate bacteria-killing [particles] in the weave of fiber that can be used for implants and reusable catheters and colonoscopes,” said Sukenik, who has used his chemistry background and applied it to nano-scale structures. AS ISRAEL’s demography changes and the birth rate in the haredi communities surges, even the International Monetary Fund has recognized that having so many young people with little or no secular education and few going to work (the situation is similar among Arab Israeli women), the country’s future economy is faced with serious dangers. The new Bank of Israel governor, Karnit Flug, warned recently that a shrinking work force cannot support the economy unless haredi men pursue academic studies and go to work. This problem is regarded by the national leadership as more urgent – and easier to solve – than refusal to serve in the IDF. The stigma of Israeli haredim against going to college – if it is gender separated – has diminished. President Shimon Peres, who recently made a first-ever visit by a state president to JCT, made a point of asking to see only haredi graduates and students – even though modern Orthodox graduates are responsible for huge technological achievements in the IDF. Of the 8,000 students from haredi world who are pursuing a higher education – including women – 1,700 are at JCT. Haredi rabbis will have to face competition that they never had before, and their yeshivot for adult men will be set aside more for very bright Talmud scholars and others will go to study a profession and go out to work, said Sukenik. “Stipends will become differential. There is more variety in the haredi world, and things are changing, just as they did in the Diaspora.” At JCT itself, Sukenik appointed a committee headed by Rabbi Dr. Mordechai Halperin to re-think and upgrade its Torah studies program. “We must maintain the highest academic level both in that and our scientific studies.” BY THE end of his four-year term, Sukenik hopes the academic level at the Lev Academic Center “will be even higher, as good as any university in the country, just like graduates at gender-separated Yeshiva College can be accepted to doctoral programs at Cal-Tech. We will bolster our efforts to be in touch with graduates, and our placement will continue to help them find jobs. In addition, we working to promote the development of scientific infrastructure and strengthen research.” To view the original article on JPost, click here share in social medias: Previous Update Next Update More Updates Where does Israel go from here?

The modern Orthodox men on the Givat Mordechai campus join the Israel Defense Forces before or after getting their degrees, while the haredi men - most of them with wives and children and no scientific, mathematics or English-language background - go straight from their yeshivot to a year of preparatory classes to matriculate and then to their studies, without IDF service.\" Click here to read the full article at JPost.com share in social medias: Previous Update Next Update More Updates Where does Israel go from here?

Centennial College Signs with JCT to Promote International Education Home Page News and Updates ... Centennial College Signs with JCT to Promote International Education The agreements will create linkages between Ontario’s first public college and a number of Israeli post secondary educational organizations. October 2013 Centennial College signs five Memoranda of Understanding (MOU) with learning institutions and organizations in Israel, one of which being The Jerusalem College of Technology (JCT), as part of a concerted effort by the Scarborough Ontario, Canada based college to enhance student mobility and learning internationally. The agreements will create linkages between Ontario’s first public college and a number of Israeli post secondary educational organizations such as VARAM, the Board of Public Academic Colleges in Israel, and institutions such as the Jerusalem College of Technology, Hadassah Academic College both publicly funded Academic Colleges, Ben Gurion University of the Negev and the College of Law and Business a non-public funded Academic College. In addition, there are new ties being established with the Magen David Adom of Israel and Tel Chai College. Centennial is part of a unique trade mission to Israel organized by City of Vaughan Mayor Maurizio Bevilacqua, who is leading a delegation of representatives from the city’s private and public-sector organizations to meet with key Israeli associations and industries. The focus of the week-long mission will be on Tel Aviv, the nation’s business and financial capital, with additional trips to other centres. While an important aspect of the trade mission is to assist Canadian businesses to expand and succeed by linking with firms in the innovative and dynamic economy of Israel, Centennial and other colleges are looking for new academic partners to enhance learning opportunities for their students, and opportunities for collaborative research, innovation  and commercialization. “We are continuing to build our global presence by coming to Israel for the first time, a market that is world-renowned for its technological innovations and entrepreneurial economy,” says Brad Chapman, CFO and Vice President Business Development, Centennial College. “We’re excited by the prospect of creating pathways between institutions for students to gain remarkable learning opportunities across cultures and across oceans. Israel has much to offer us.” Centennial College will be joining the City of Vaughan at its new Israel trade office, which will facilitate information requests and business opportunities. With a permanent presence in Israel, Centennial will be able to recruit international students and offer corporate training programs to Israeli firms. Established in 1966, Centennial College offers programs in business, community and health studies, communications, science and engineering technology, general arts, hospitality and transportation. Centennial has a presence in several countries around the globe and currently hosts 5,000 international students at its Toronto campuses. share in social medias: Previous Update Next Update More Updates Where does Israel go from here?

However students should check with specific colleges as each has different requirements for transfer credits. Questions? Israel Defense Prize for JCT Alum Home Page News and Updates ... Israel Defense Prize for JCT Alum Col. Yaniv Avitan, a graduate of the Jerusalem College of Technology’s (JCT) Electro-Optics Engineering Department, received the 2018 Israel Defense Prize from the Israeli Ministry of Defense for his role heading a team that works to detect the Hamas terror group’s cross-border attack tunnels. This marks the second consecutive year and the fourth time in the past decade that a JCT graduate has received this prestigious award. Avitan is head of the Collection and Assault Unit of the Technological Division of the Ground Forces of the Israel Defense Forces (IDF). His team developed \"The Brain\" which is a nickname for the laboratory they established in 2016 and in the last two years has located nine of Hamas’s underground tunnels that were dug from the Gaza Strip into Israeli territory. The team includes experts from the IDF, the Ministry of Defense, academic institutions, and the defense industry. As modern electro-optics applications are increasingly implemented in electronics, modern communications, medicine, data processing, energy, and especially the security field, JCT’s electro-optics department prepares professionals for R&D work by providing them with a strong foundation in applied physics, electronics, and computers. Graduates of the electro-optics program master the planning of optical systems and instruments, lasers and other light sources, photoelectric light detectors, electro-optic light modulation, holography, devices for television photography as well as night vision devices, and computer assisted lens design. The threat of Hamas’s cross-border tunnel network was particularly prominent during Israel’s 2014 summer war in Gaza. The IDF destroyed more than 30 of the so-called “terror tunnels” during that conflict, but the military continues to discover and dismantle the tunnels today, several years after Operation Protective Edge. Avitan, aged 42, grew up in Netivot and lives in Sderot, both situated in southern Israel near the Gaza border—meaning the tunnel threat and other forms of terrorism have long been a reality of his daily life. He has researched the Hamas tunnels since 2013. “We developed an algorithm into which data was fed, combined with assessments of the security situation and decisions about where to drill, where to dig, where to attack, and what to handle,” says Avitan. “The breakthrough was not only technological, but also in the way people worked - technology professionals left their laboratories and went out in the field, in complete contrast to the norms of their military service. Various defense industries joined the Lab. There were great challenges, but everyone went full steam ahead. We are pretty confident in the method. It speaks for itself when it comes to locating tunnels.” Avitan calls his team’s tunnel-detection breakthrough “a highlight of my career.” When asked why he chose to stay in the army when using his skills to develop a start-up could potentially make him millions, Avitan simply stated that the fields outside of the army \"can't provide the sense of meaning that IDF service offers.\" “The most dramatic moment was the first time the system proved itself,” he recalls. “You hit the tunnel and it’s very exciting. As a resident of the area, I understand very well what this means for civilians. The tunnel that we most recently detected (about a month ago) threatened the lives of IDF soldiers and residents of the Gaza vicinity. It was discovered a short distance from where my family lives.\" share in social medias: Previous Update Next Update More Updates Where does Israel go from here?

Stroke Detection App Ma’ayan Sinai and Shani Ben-Ari from the JCT's Tal Campus won a prize for their part in developing an application that identifies and notifies patient of early signs of stroke and other vascular diseases. December 2018 We promote joint research between academia and industry and encourage our fourth year engineering students to engage with technologically advanced projects.  We even provide our students with a tech development lab and professional support.  It’s a win-win situation: the entrepreneur receives a solution to a need as well as an initial model of the product before there is funding to back it and the students acquire experience in high-level industry development, which often opens doors to later employment with the company. By: Orly Harari Ma’ayan Sinai and Shani Ben-Ari, students from the Department of Industrial Engineering and Management at the Tal Campus of the Lev Academic Center in Jerusalem, were awarded the “Outstanding Projects Award of 2018” by the Academy of Information and Technology.  The prize was awarded to them for their contribution to the development of an application interface, together with BGSegev, a startup headed by Gil Segev.  The app identifies early signs of stroke and other vascular diseases, warning of suspected outbreaks if symptoms appear in the patient. Sinai and Ben-Ari, who were excited to receive the award stated: \"We would like to thank the Committee for trusting in this revolutionary development.  The app is aimed at saving people’s lives from a disease ranked one of the leading causes of death in the Western world today.  It is a great privilege for us to be partners of this important project. \" Eti Stern, Head of JCT’s Tal Campus explained, \"We promote joint research between academia and industry and encourage our fourth year engineering students to engage with technologically advanced projects.  We even provide our students with a tech development lab and professional support.  It’s a win-win situation: the entrepreneur receives a solution to a need as well as an initial model of the product before there is funding to back it and the students acquire experience in high-level industry development, which often opens doors to later employment with the company.\" share in social medias: Previous Update Next Update More Updates Where does Israel go from here?

Schreiber LevTech Entrepreneurship Center Schreiber LevTech Entrepreneurship Center The program gave us an in-depth understanding of what it means to be an entrepreneur.  I learned practical tools and received professional guidance about how to establish venture.  It also exposed us to people and connections in the start-up community in Israel and around the world. - Sari Tayar, Industrial Engineering and Management Launched in October 2017, JCT’s Schreiber LevTech Entrepreneurship Center offers a range of programs for students to get their feet wet and gain valuable experience in the real world of entrepreneurship on campus.  Through Schreiber LevTech, students are given the resources and opportunities to create products, hone their skills and ability to think innovatively. Students work under the professional guidance of professional business and tech mentors.  They build teams and create products through Schreiber LevTech LAB , a pre-accelerator program, exposure and opportunity to create tech solutions for challenges presented by companies and social service organizations in campus Hackathons (technology marathons), and Schreiber LevTech Talks encouraging creative thinking in the business and high-tech spheres. Schreiber LevTech LAB Pre-Accelerator Schreiber LevTech gave me tools and taught me important concepts that I would never have learned in any other place during my studies. - Shalom Rochman, Software Engineering The LAB Pre-Accelerator partners with industry to bring industry to campus.  Student entrepreneurs are given the opportunity to develop a product or venture and when products are ready to be marketed, JCT connects students to a wide network of investors. The program meets once a week for three hours over the course of one semester. One of last year’s participating startup teams was FlyTech, a company that integrates aerial tools for unmanned and remotely piloted aircraft systems (drones) for the civilian market. Course topics include: Understanding the lifecycle of innovation from ideation to product development Market research Marketing strategies Product differentiation Understanding profit models How to choose partners and build teams Networking and fundraising Targeting and presenting to investors Legal issues, regulations and financial management How to develop an elevator pitch and professional presentation skills JCT Hackathons Hackathons “technology marathons”, take place within an intensive, short period of time (typically 48-hours), provide a platform for students to design and develop prototypes of products to solve the problems presented by industry and organizations. Approximately 100 students compete in each hackathon, which also teach creative thinking and provide exposure to multi-national companies, start-ups and VCs. Such exposure is particularly important for the orthodox and ultra-orthodox community, who typically lack contacts in these spheres. Increasingly, industry looks to hackathons to identify potential future employees. The goal of a hackathon is to create a potentially marketable software or hardware product by the end of the event. During campus hackathons, students from engineering, business, and accounting programs join forces to create technology products and provide solutions to challenges presented by children’s hospitals, tech firms, retail and commercial sites, organizations working on technology for people with disabilities, and more. Students practice working in interdisciplinary teams, improve upon or learn technology skills, and gain confidence developing products for the non-profit sector and the high-tech industry. Three hackathons have been held through the program since its inception less than two years ago. Among these was JCT's first women's hackathon, in which participants, some of whom were nursing mothers with their babies in hand, developed products such as: An electronic bracelet to help paramedics with triage in mass-casualty incidents An “escape room” (a series of rooms with high-level games and riddles that need to be solved in order to “escape\") for the blind and the sighted together A product that uses machine learning and image processing to aid in homeland security Schreiber LevTech Talks Attended by students from across the College’s departments, Schreiber LevTech Talks provide insight into the world of innovation in Israel. Mentors and role models from industry discuss the challenges they face, showing the students that even the most successful face obstacles on their way to success. We place emphasis on providing female mentors and lecturers for our women's program. We feel strongly that having the example of women such as themselves serving in these roles demonstrates and encourages them what they can achieve. These engaging lectures are given by leading professionals in the business and tech fields by figures such as Nir Barkat, Jerusalem’s former Mayor and entrepreneur in his own right;  David Leichner VP of Marketing at SQream Technologies and former VP of Cynet and Gilat Satellite Networks; Bob Rosenchein, CEO and founder of Answers.com and Curiyo; and Col. (Res.) Yossi Golan a VP of the Intelligence Unit at Elbit, an aerospace and Defense Company.

Bodenheimer Ilana Attia Individual Insight in the Study of Torah–The Legacy of B’Or Ha’Torah Professor Chaim Sukenik Over its four decades of publication, B’Or Ha’Torah and its diverse collection of essays have contributed many new insights to the world of Torah study. As this era comes to an end, I would like to consider a legacy of such a Torah publication that goes beyond the specific content of any of its articles. An approach to Torah-learning with which I very much identify is that each of us must see Torah through the lens of his/her own experience, education, and personality. I would like to suggest that this is the ultimate expression of Our Sages’ dictum that there are seventy (many) faces to Torah. The study of Torah is a many-faceted endeavor that encourages creativity and individual expression. Its diversity reflects the diversity of humankind. Unification of the Laws of Nature by Refining Newtonian Dynamics Professor Yaakov Friedman Based upon a presentation at the Twelfth Miami International Conference on Torah and Science at The Shul of Bal Harbour, Surfside, Florida, December 21- 24, 2017 The oneness of G-d is the source of our world. Scientific search for “oneness” in the world helps us appreciate and understand this. The classical physics initiated by Isaac Newton was a “theory of everything.” But in the nineteenth century the shortcomings of this theory became apparent. Albert Einstein resolved some of them by his special and general relativities. Einstein’s theories, however, do not explain microscopic (atomic) behavior, nowadays explained by quantum mechanics. The disparity between relativity and quantum mechanics prevents the unification of laws of physics. My colleagues and I propose a new geometric model for describing the dynamics of objects and particles under the influence of any forces. The model assumes that any moving object “senses” spacetime individually, depending on the forces affecting it. The spacetime of an object can be defined by the way it is translating space and time increments from flat spacetime to the corresponding increments in the spacetime of the objects. This translation is called a metric. We propose a Universal Law of Inertia that maintains that: “An inanimate object always moves uniformly in its own spacetime.” The motion curve of such an object is the shortest path in his spacetime. We have shown that the metric of an object can be derived from the Newtonian potential of all forces affecting the object. We name this new geometric dynamics Relativistic Newtonian Dynamics (RND). RND coincides with Newtonian dynamics for weak forces and low velocities but also accurately describes non-classical behavior described by General Relativity (GR). Unlike GR, RND is not limited to gravitation and can be applied to any force. It also explains the source of the change of behavior in the microscopic region. Nature, Nurture, and Human Behavior Professor Joseph S. Bodenheimer Is human behavior determined by a person’s genes (“nature”) or by the environment, either prenatal or during a person’s life (“nurture”)? Scientists now realize that it is fundamentally impossible to fully predict an individual’s behavior in real life. We review the basic physical principles involved in the nature versus nurture debate. Then we discuss the unique facility of human beings to choose their mode of behavior over and above nature-and-nurture-based choices. The Torah teaches us the qualitative value-based distinction between animal life and humankind, from which arises our responsibility to G-d for us to control our choices. We present the thesis that it is this obligation, rather than entitlement to protection of our human rights, that should serve as the basis for a universal code of behavior for human beings. Freedom of Choice and Artificial Intelligence Professor Joseph Mayer Jacobson Recent advances in technologies for imaging the brain at unprecedented resolution and throughput hold forth the prospect of mapping the human brain at the level of individual neuronal connections in the next ten to fifteen years. In parallel, continued geometric advances in computational scale and cost hold forth the likely capability of being able, on the basis of such a brain map, to simulate the human brain with sufficient precision to be able to recapitulate significant aspects of human brain function. These coming advances bring into sharp focus the question of the scientific basis of free choice. Free Will, G-d, and Science: From Rambam to Laplace to Schrodinger Professor Nathan Aviezer Based upon a presentation at the Twelfth Miami International Conference on Torah and Science at The Shul of Bal Harbour, Surfside, Florida, December 21- 24, 2017 Everyone believes that he possesses free will and thus has the ability to act in the future as he chooses. I am going to discuss the challenge to free will that arises from physics. Newtonian physics asserts that the future behavior of every object is determined by the forces that are acting on it now: the present determines the future. The key point is that human beings do not differ from inanimate objects in any way that would invalidate this principle. However, free will asserts the exact opposite, namely, that the present does not determine the future. Since the existence of free will contradicts the laws of physics, it follows that free will cannot exist, and our feeling that we possess free will must be an illusion. In the twentieth century, there occurred the greatest revolution in the history of science, called quantum theory. I will show that one of the conclusions of quantum theory is that free will does not contradict the laws of physics. Therefore, there is no reason to doubt our feeling that we each possess free will. The Torah states that G-d bestows upon every human being the ability to decide, without His interference, whether or not to obey G-d’s commandments. This is the essence of free will. Shayetet-13 and the Kishon River—Who is Responsible for  Environmental Hazards? Shimon Lerner LERNER ABSTRACT How do we assess and quantify statistical hazards? Can we prove the existence of a causal link in cases where the evidence is based only on statistical measurements? Most environmental hazards, being statistical in nature, fall into this category. This makes it difficult to pin the responsibility for dealing with them on any single entity, ultimately leaving everyone in a dangerous situation. The tragic story of the divers from the IDF’s elite Navy SEALS unit, provides a poignant and illuminating illustration. Was the unusually high occurrence of cancer among veteran divers related to their training in the polluted Kishon River? Shaul Mofaz (Defense Minister at the time) famously decided to compensate the families of the divers, despite the findings of a special commission stating there wasn’t enough statistical evidence in support of the claim. This story emphasizes the necessity of finding a way to deal with these issues. Who must take responsibility for such kinds of statistical hazards? What does halakhah have to say on such matters? On the one hand, there is no greater example of pikuah nefesh (lives at stake). On the other, the lack of direct causality complicates matters. It is therefore, not enough to merely stress the obligation of protecting the environment. A framework must be developed which places clear and actionable responsibility on well-defined parties. I shall propose a possible outline of such a halakhic framework. This framework shall then be applied to the case of the Shayetet as well as the case of CO 2 emissions into the environment. המרת איסור חמור באיסור קל יותר - מוטב שיאכל רוטב ולא שומן פרופסר זאב לב ז\"ל מאמר זה דן בשתי שאלות כלליות, שיש להן השלכות על כל מהלכי החיים המודרניים: 1. באילו תנאים אומרים לאדם, שעלול לחטוא באיסור חמור, לעשות עבירה קלה יותר כדי להימנע מאיסור חמור? 2. מתי מותר, ולפעמים מחויב אדם לחטוא, כדי שיינצל חברו? בשאלה הראשונה, האדם שהמיר את העבירה החמורה בקלה יותר, הוא החוטא, שעובר את העבירה. במקרה השני, כשאומרים לאדם לעשות עבירה כדי לזכות את חברו, הוא אינו עומד לעבור עבירה. השלכות שהזמן גרמן לשאלות אלו, הן סידורי עבודה בתעשייה שמחליפים איסורי דאורייתא בעבודה בשבת באיסורי דרבנן, הזמנת אורחים מחללי שבת לסעודת שבת כאשר ידוע שהם ייסעו ברכב אחרי הסעודה, התרת נישואים בתנאים מסוימים כדי למנוע אשת איש או ריבוי ממזרים. בהלכה נקבע כי אומרים לאדם 'חטא', כדי שיזכה חברו כאשר יש מצווה לרבים, מצווה רבה או מניעת עבירה של רבים, ובעניין זה יש הבדל בין צורכי ציבור ובין צורכי היחיד חיזוק האמונה על ידי העיון בטבע – מדברי רבותינו פרופ' צבי אפרים וינברגר על פי דעתם של חלק מרבותינו הראשונים והאחרונים יש חיוב ללמוד את החכמות הטבעיות כדי להכיר את גבורת ה'. שיטה זאת משותפת לרמב\"ם, אבן עזרא, רבי יצחק ישראלי תלמיד הרא\"ש והרמ\"א. המקורות לחיוב זה הם ממקראות בתורה ובנביאים. דברי רבותינו הראשונים נאמרו עוד לפני עידן הפיזיקה המודרנית המיוסדת על העיקרון של האי-ודאות. לפני כמאה שנה האיר ה' ברחמיו את גדולי חוקרי הטבע – הבריאה – לגלות עולם שהוא למעלה ממה שיכול אדם לתאר בדמיונו האנושי. הפיזיקה החדשה גילתה עולם מורכב מודרך על ידי חוקים עמוקים ומורכבים, עולם מתואר היטב מבחינה מתמטית אבל גם נסתר ומעבר ליכולת האדם לדמיין מציאות שבה רב הנסתר מן הנגלה. לרוב חוקרי הטבע היום יש מידה נאה של צניעות ואימת הרוממות לפני מי שברא כל אלה. לימודי מדעי זמננו מחייבים השקעת זמן ומאמץ שכלי רב. חלק מממצאי המדע היום עומדים בסתירה לקבלתנו התורנית. החריף בהם הוא גיל היקום. חכמינו עמדו בפרץ ליישב הסתירה. הבנה בתהליך הבריאה על פי הקבלה מאת רבי יצחק דמן עכו, תלמיד הרמב\"ן, משווה את גיל היקום על פי החוקרים עם גיל היקום על פי הבריאה. לעומת שיטתם של אלו מרבותינו הראשונים המחייבים לימודי המדעים, סבור הנצי\"ב כי הלימוד והמחקר של החכמות הטבעיות הם מצווה לאומות העולם ולא לישראל. אעלה השערה כי רוב חכמי ישראל היום יתפשו את שיטת הנצי\"ב עקב ההשקעה הרבה של זמן הדרוש להבין מדעי זמננו, שבהכרח יבוא על חשבון לימודי בית המדרש אף שאלו ואלו נתיבים בעבודת ה'. מדעי הטבע והיהדות כמקצועות משלימים פרופסור יהודה לוי ז\"ל לפני כמאה שנים היה זה באופנה להתווכח על הסתירות שבין הדת והמדע.* ואמנם נראה, שיש נקודות של התנגשות בין השניים; אך עיון מעמיק יותר יגלה, שלכל הפחות בכל הנוגע ליהדות: א. רוב הסתירות הן תוצאה של אי-הבנה כלשהי – בין בדת בין במדע; ב. אפילו אותן סתירות שלכאורה נשארות, עוסקות תמיד בנקודות שוליות, ואינן נוגעות במהותם של המדע והדת. הגיע הזמן אפוא לבחון את יחסי הגומלין וההשלמה ההדדית שבין המדע והיהדות, וכך נגלה מושגים עמוקים ומרכזיים הרבה יותר מאלה העולים מתוך הסתירות המדומות. לפני שניגש לבירור יחסים אלה, הבה נברר בקיצור מה הם התפקידים והיסודות של שני המקצועות הללו. בינה מלאכותית—מחשבות וכיווני פסיקה הרב יוסף צבי רימון הבינה המלאכותית Artificial Intelligence היא למעשה מערכת ממוחשבת המנסה ליצור חשיבה הדומה לזו של האדם. הבינה המלאכותית התפתחה מאוד בשנים האחרונות. בעבר, הבינה המלאכותית הייתה מסוגלת לבצע דברים שביקשו ממנה או דברים שתוכננו בתוכה. היא הייתה יכולה לפעול גם בצורה מחוכמת על פי נוסחאות וסטטיסטיקות/ תורה ומדע—עולם אחד של בורא עולם פרופ' נח דנא-פיקארד התורה מתארת בפסוקים ספורים את גדלותו של עם ישראל בעיני הגויים. שתי סיבות לזה מוזכרות ע”י התורה, האחת היא קרבת ה’ אלוקינו, העונה “בְּכָל קָרְאֵנוּ אֵלָיו”( דברים ד, ז). השנייה היא שיש לנו תורה, המתוארת כ-”חֻקִּים וּמִשְׁפָּטִים צַדִּיקִם” (שם שם, ח עם זאת, לפני הסיבות האלה מביאה התורה הסבר אחר )שם שם, ו(: “וּשְׁמַרְתֶּם וַעֲשִׂיתֶם כִּי הִוא חָכְמַתְכֶם וּבִינַתְכֶם לְעֵינֵי הָעַמִּים אֲשֶׁר יִשְׁמְעוּן אֵת כָּל הַחֻקִּים הָאֵלֶּה וְאָמְרוּ רַק עַם חָכָם וְנָבוֹן הַגּוֹי הַגָּדוֹל הַזֶּה”. לפי ההבנה הקלאסית, הביטוי “חָכְמַתְכֶם וּבִינַתְכֶם” מציין את התורה כולה, כפי שמפרט הכתוב בהמשך. Judith S. Bendheim Guedalia, PhD The aim of this paper is to propose the introduction of a communal ritual as a posttrauma early intervention technique. There are specific community- oriented methods for dealing with trauma survivors; we believe that, in particular, the Jewish ritual of Birkhat Ha’Gomel (the blessing recited when saved from danger) is helpful for reducing chronic effects of trauma. Similar posttrauma traditions are seen in other ethnic groups, such as the Navajo; those will be briefly discussed as well. It is important to note that therapies that are currently employed as the result of years of research have many similarities to those rituals that have existed for thousands of years. When providing early intervention for a trauma survivor, it is important to be aware of culturally appropriate treatments as well as the most commonly used professional methods. A combination of these techniques may be effective to alleviate acute stress disorder and prevent chronic posttraumatic stress in the general public.

Professor Yaakov Friedman × Professor Yaakov Friedman of the Jerusalem College of Technology was born in the town of Munkatch in the former Soviet Union. His father was one of the leaders of the local Jewish community. He graduated from the Faculty of Mathematics and Mechanics of Moscow University in 1971 just prior to his a liyah. He spent a year at Yeshivat Tomkhey Tmimim Kfar H abad to upgrade his spiritual education, received his PhD in mathematics from Tel Aviv University, and served eight years at the University of California Los Angeles and Irvine as a faculty member and researcher. Upon returning to Israel he served at the Jerusalem College of Technology as lecturer, rector, and vice president for research and head of research authority. He initiated and acted as research and development director of several hi-tech startups and companies. The Lubavitcher Rebbe directed him to continue a career in science as a step for preparing the world for the messianic era . His research is in pure and applied mathematics, statistics, and theoretical and experimental physics. He is currently developing a new extension of Einstein's Theory of Relativity and testing it at the best synchrotron radiation facilities in Europe. This theory can provide a new insight in understanding microscopic behavior and a breakthrough in quantum computing. friedman@g.jct.ac.il Professor Joseph S.

A \"Still Small Voice\" from the Beginning of Time: A Jewish View on the Discovery of Gravitational Waves Shimon Lerner One of the most exciting recent scientific discoveries was the discovery of gravitational waves at the Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatories (LIGO) in Louisiana and Washington. This multimillion-dollar project, with a collaboration of over 1,000 multinational researchers, finally registered its first detection of a gravitational wave, confirming the actual existence of gravitational waves, which had been speculated since Einstein’s paper just over 100 years ago. The importance of this discovery was immediately recognized by the scientific community at large, quickly earning three of the observatory’s conceptualizers and designers the 2017 Nobel Prize in Physics. This article outlines the importance of this discovery and suggests how to view it from a Jewish, faith-based perspective. See the three images including artists’ conceptions of gravitational waves on the inside front cover of this volume. Experimenting in the Laboratory of the A-lmighty: Astronomy and the Observant Jewish Scientist Professor Yaakov Friedman How should an observant Jewish scientist view astronomy? I do not think that he should spend time on what has happened at the time of creation and speculate how things happened based on the assumption (used in astronomy) that the universe owas created according to the laws of nature. Rather, remembering that God does not do anything without a purpose, he should use his scientific knowledge and intellect to unravel the mysteries and reveal the hints of the heavenly lab. Such activity helps to discover and test new laws of nature which could improve our life and strengthen our belief in God. I present my personal experiences in using astronomical observations to construct and verify an extension of Einstein’s Theory of Relativity. This theory has the potential to explain microscopic behavior as well and has applications to quantum computing. “The Fullness Thereof”: The Significance of the Higgs Mechanism in Jewish Thought and Theology Daniel Turgeman Our fundamental understanding of matter has been revolutionized in the past century. This revolution reached a climax in 2012 with the discovery of the Higgs boson — the proof of the mechanism that generates particle masses. The conclusion, with regard to our understanding of matter, is that there is no such thing as “matter.” The first section of this article is devoted to explaining the scientific theory, while the second section delves into the theological meaning of this new paradigm. The science content below was published in a previous article in Hebrew by Daniel Turgeman, \"Light, Matter, and the Higgs Boson.\" 2016. Galileo Journal for Science and Thought , vol.210, March, pp. 20–27. In Search of the Halakhic Definition of Motherhood Rabbi Professor Avraham Steinberg, MD Are we allowed to assist infertile couples to have children? There is a host of options available and more new techniques that will become available in the future. I am going to discuss the issue of the female factor of infertility that requires an egg donation and/or a surrogate mother. I shall also refer to Mitochondria Replacement Therapy. In every case, the question will be asked, “According to halakhah, who is the mother of the child?” Gene Editing Research: Halakhic Parameters Rabbi Professor Moshe Dovid Tendler The decision by the medical profession in England to permit MRT-mitochondrial replacement therapy crossed the “red line” of gene therapy, allowing alterations of the germ plasm of a human. Previously, only somatic cells were subjected to genetic modification, and in this framework any deleterious re-combinations would not impact on all future generations. MRT can impact on the 12,000 women in the US who have defective mitochondria causing heart, liver, and respiratory disease. MRT replaces the defective mitochondria with healthy donor mitochondria, without impacting on the genetic traits that are controlled by nuclear genes. MRT thus allows these women to bear genetically related children free of mitochondrial disease without resorting to donor ova. Clinical trials are now underway for the maturation of MRT as a viable cure. If it could be concluded from animal studies that any risk to volunteers is minimal, halakhah would encourage participation in FDA-sponsored studies. A powerful genome-editing technology, CRISPR/Cas 9, has made it easy to insert, remove, or edit genes in sperm, ova, and embryos, potentially curing genetic diseases or enhancing desirable traits. Leading molecular biologists have protested gene editing of humans since any errors will persist for all time in the human genome. In addition, they are concerned that this technique will be used for genetic enhancement or “designer babies,” rather than for medical cures. Despite these concerns, halakhah would favor continued research with its potential to cure genetic diseases, even if a modicum of risk exists. Other new discoveries in immunotherapy will be discussed. At the Intersection of Torah and Cardiology Dr. Michael Szycher What is the Jewish position on organ transplants in general and on heart transplants from deceased donors, artificial hearts, and artificial heart-part implants in particular? Most of the possible answers lack consensus because they deal with multifaceted and interrelated religious, medical, ethical, societal, and philosophical approaches, such as the definition of the moment of death. The very definition of the heart itself is also a subject for discussion. While working on the development of an artificial heart, my team and I encountered a complexity totally unexpected from a medical standpoint. At the beginning of the 1980s the medical community widely believed that developing an artificial heart would be a simple affair, since the heart was considered only as a “pump.” We were forced to rewrite the books on hematology, hemodynamics, cardiovascular technology, implantable electronics, cardiac telemetry, the role of coagulation in bacterial infection, and so on. This led to the inference that life is too complex to be explained by random chance, as proposed by evolutionary theory. As a result, 45 percent of my scientific team and I, who had proudly professed to be secular at the start of the program, became instilled with a belief in God. We found that science alone cannot explain the totality of the world. Communication: A Divine Feature of Humanity Professor Joseph S. Bodenheimer This paper explores various expressions of Divine dialogue as they relate to humans, essentially differentiating us from all other created beings. The highest form of communication is with the Almighty, but the unique gift of the human mind enables dialogue with other humans too. Meaningful human communication constitutes a powerful manifestation of our divine spirit, and must be recognized as such. But it also gives us the moral responsibility for what we choose to communicate, and how we communicate with each other. Often communication does not achieve the result desired by the communicator, not only because of misunderstanding but also by intent. The Torah warns us against the negative potential of misused social communication. There is no fundamental reason why not to use modern communications devices for sacred dialogue, on condition that the technology does not distort the spiritual significance of meaningful communication. The Second Creation Narrative in the Second Chapter of Genesis: A New Approach Professor Nathan Aviezer We learn about the creation of the world in two chapters of Genesis. The first chapter narrative (“In the beginning, God created the heaven and the earth…”) is followed by a very different second-chapter narrative (“These are the generations of the heaven and the earth when they were created…”). Biblical critics claim that these two narratives were written by two different authors and later joined by an anonymous editor to form the book of Genesis. Biblical critics also point to the different expressions for God in the two narratives. They claim that the two different names of God further support their thesis of two different authors. Various explanations have been proposed for the two creation narratives by those who remain faithful to a single Divine Author. We here propose a new explanation which answers the following questions. What does the second creation narrative contribute to the first creation narrative? Why do different names for God appear in the two narratives? Why are the two narratives so different? For example, in the first narrative, the plants precede man, whereas in the second, man precedes the plants. Adam is described as “created” in the first narrative, but “formed” in the second. Why are these two very different verbs used to describe the same event? Why is there mention of the raw materials (“dust of the earth”) from which man was formed? For no other item in either creation narrative are the raw materials mentioned. Meditation, the Brain, and Judaism Daniel A. Drubach The existence and role of meditation in the practice of Judaism, as well as its relationship to prayer, is an area of much debate. Part of this stems from a lack of agreement about the meaning, practice, and purpose of meditation, and specifically meditation within a Jewish context. Adding to the confusion is the tendency to consider prayer and meditation as the same process. This paper proposes that Mishnah Brakhot 5:1 and Talmud Brakhot 32b present convincing evidence for a vital role of meditation in the practice of Judaism and support the opinion that meditation and prayer are different (albeit harmonious) processes. Furthermore, a neuroscience approach demonstrates that meditation and prayer are distinct cognitive processes, the former nonverbal while the latter a highly verbal task. Finally, we discuss recently discovered brain functional networks (including the default and salience networks) which play a fundamental but distinct role in both meditation and prayer. Knower, Knowledge, and Known:  Maimonides’ Nutritional Science, the Cultivation of Consciousness, and the Future of Medicine Simcha Gottlieb In the Mishneh Torah the great physician, philosopher, codifier, and commentator Maimonides guarantees that a person who follows his guidelines for healthy eating and other behaviors will never need a doctor. I suggest that the reason why Maimonides could make such a guarantee in the Mishneh Torah while being much more cautious in his medical writings is that he is concerned not only about what and how we eat but why we eat, for what purpose. Maimonides introduces the Mishneh Torah with the statement that the purpose of all life is to know God. Following Maimonides’ practical guidelines in the context of striving to know God in our every action will enrich and lengthen our lives. But how can finite humans know the infinite God? Correlating Maimonides’ characterization of God as “the Knower, the Knowledge, and the Known” with three levels of daat and three stages of hasidic meditation during prayer helps us solve these questions. My Response to the Lubavitcher Rebbe’s Call  for Kosher Therapeutic Meditation Rus Devorah Wallen In private communications as well as public addresses, Rabbi Menaħem Mendel Schneerson, the Lubavitcher Rebbe, discussed an array of holistic health issues At times he recommended very specific therapies or techniques that predated current medical treatments. One example is value-free therapeutic meditation to relieve stress and bring peace of mind (see Ophir 2012–2013 and Landes 2014–2015). As an observant therapist inspired by the Rebbe’s call for new therapies, I developed rabbinically approved meditations for my patients. Today, research on the benefits of meditation abounds, and medical professionals around the world use many formats of meditation to alleviate anxiety, stress, and other ailments. However, despite their proven benefit, many of the available methods contain subtle Eastern religious elements. Lack of access to the value-free meditation methods the Rebbe recommended exposed thousands to practices violating Torah law. Internet Addiction in the Observant Community Norman Goldwasser Although there are many positive uses of the internet, there are also many toxic effects of internet addiction that unfortunately plague the Torah-observant community. The damage that is done by this type of activity can be antithetical to Jewish values. Exposure to pornography can lead to inappropriate sexual activity, child abuse, and marriage dysfunction. The problem must be recognized and solved by proper parental supervision, guidance in school, use of filters and safeguards, and seeking spiritual and professional help for healing and recovery. Writing in the Face of Cynicism:  Addressing Three Bio-Graphies of the Lubavitcher Rebbe,  Rabbi Menahem Mendel Schneerson Professor Menachem Feuer Jewish Studies, York University, Toronto, Canada Biographies of great individuals are always the subject of debate. What is remembered, how is it remembered, and does the account have veracity? There is potentially always a kind of suspicion or cynicism that surrounds a biography because writing has a life of its own and words can always be interpreted in different ways. The fact that writing ( graphos ) clashes with living memory presents a challenge which can undermine any biographical project and the message of a life ( bios ). Even archived memory is subject to radical doubt (see Derrida 1989, pp. 37–38) Based upon a presentation at the Eleventh Miami International Conference on Torah and Science at The Shul of Bal Harbour,Surfside, Florida, December 14, 2015 Reassessing the Supreme Test:  Akeidat Yitsħak in the Light of Today’s Assessment Theories Emmy Leah Stark Zitter The most significant “test” recounted in the Torah is the story of God’s testing of Abraham, called in Hebrew ạkeidat Yitshak (the Binding of Isaac). Told in sparing detail, this story is perhaps too deep and puzzling to be completely comprehended by human thought or explained in human language. Viewing the story through the lens of contemporary pedagogical theories of assessment, however, suggests new interpretations and meanings in the archetypal tale. I begin with an overview describing today’s assessment theories, defining terms such as formative and summative assessment, washback, and assessment as learning. I then apply these ideas to the story of Abraham’s test, working with and relating to the stance of classic commentators on the subject. Finally, I use my conclusions about the meaning of Abraham’s test to discuss the relationship between ideas of our times and their connection to the timeless text of the Torah. I conclude that applying secular thought in the ideas of the Torah, while a delicate and complex process, can be a useful and even necessary way to understand the relevance of a timeless text to a humanity bound in time.

Greenway and the Torah Blueprint for Creation Robert Appleson The Zohar and Midrash Rabbah say God used the Torah as a blueprint in creating the world. Based on the Torah itself, the Talmud states this creation involved the Hebrew letter ה (hei), as illustrated by its shape presaging tshuvah (repentance) in our environment. Beyond that spiritual contribution are signs of a material aspect involving the iterative structure of the Torah, based on the five shared principles of the Ten Commandments taught in Midrash Mekhilta. In particular, this structure appears in the mathematical constant phi (roughly 1.618) embodied in a regular pentagon, which geometrically represents the number five. Research has shown that our sense of beauty is neurologically sensitive to phi. This confirms God’s blessing of the gift of aesthetics to Yefet, progenitor of the early Greeks, who discovered this constant. We have long recognized the role of phi in a host of growth phenomena in ways worthy of a blueprint. Thus, we can read the Zohar and Midrash Rabbah as saying God used the Torah’s fivefold iterative structure to model phi in creating the world. A Fresh Look at Genesis Chapters 2–5: Activation of Our Divine Potential Professor Joseph S. Bodenheimer The first chapter of Genesis describes the creation ex nihilo of the entire universe and Man. The second chapter is usually understood to give a different account of creation. This paper suggests that, rather than presenting an alternative version of Creation, the second chapter and those thereafter are actually a continuation of the first chapter, describing how the latent potential of humanity was activated and expressed. Essential steps in the making of Adam and Eve into self-aware human beings were their empowerment to communicate with God and with one another, and realization of their responsibility for their deeds. Following this analysis, it is possible to distinguish between two elusive terms, tselem and dmut. New Biotechnological Ways to Begin Life Professor John D. Loike Based on a presentation at the Tenth Miami International Conference on Torah and Science, December 13–16, 2013 abstract Cloning technology has been used successfully in the past fifteen years for over twenty different species to produce embryonic stem cells or for reproductive purposes. The application of this technology for human cloning, however, has been a scientific challenge until very recently. In May of 2013, a seminal paper was published in the journal Cell that described innovative cloning technology used to create human embryonic stem cell lines from healthy individuals and from patients with genetic diseases (Tachibana et al. 2013). These scientists were not interested in using this technology for human reproduction to clone people. Nonetheless, this technology is transforming theoretical human reproductive cloning into a potential reality. The possibilities enabled by this recent breakthrough in cloning technology raises significant and challenging halakhic issues. I shall discuss the scientific basis of this technology and raise halakhic questions that emerge from this technology that our rabbinic authorities will have to adjudicate. Defining the Father in Modern Fertility Techniques Rabbi Professor Avraham Steinberg, MD Presented at the Tenth Miami International Conference on Torah and Science, December 13–16, 2013 Rabbi Professor Avraham Steinberg, MD abstract Fatherhood is one of the most basic concepts; yet, we do not find a direct definition of this term in Talmudic and Rishonim sources. Deduced from various halakhot (rulings of Jewish law), a father is defined as the man from whose sperm a woman became pregnant and delivered a child. In ancient times and until recently, this happened primarily after a direct relationship between a man and a woman. Modern fertility technologies enable the introduction of sperm into the womb of a woman by artificial insemination without physical contact between them. Moreover, it is possible to obtain sperm from a man, save it frozen, and inseminate it into a woman after the death of the man. Even more striking is the option to obtain sperm after the man died and inseminate it into a woman. Are the men in the above examples defined halakhically as fathers of the offspring? In the future, it might be possible to clone a child not only without direct contact between a man and a woman, but even without using sperm. How would fatherhood be defined in various situations of cloning? If stem cell research will come to fruition, it will be possible to create both a sperm and an egg from the same person. Who will be the father if the source of the stem cell will be a woman? Halakhic Parameters of ART (Assisted Reproduction Technology) Rabbi Professor Moshe D. Tendler Presented at the Tenth Miami International Conference on Torah and Science, December 13–16, 2013 Rabbi Professor Moshe Dovid Tendler abstract This paper will focus on several halakhic (legal/ethical/moral) dilemmas resulting from widely used ART (Assisted Reproduction Technology). A basic underlying question is whether a Jewish woman is required to fulfill the command to procreate. Is a woman allowed to risk self-injury in order to produce a child? In order for one woman to donate an egg to another woman, the donor must be prepared with physiologically unsafe dosages of reproductive hormones to force multiple ovulations, and the ovum must be removed surgically. In surrogacy, the surrogate assumes the health stresses of pregnancy and birth. Are both procedures in violation of the Torah law forbidding self-injury even for monetary compensation? Who is the true mother of a child born this way—the genetic mother or the gestational mother? Does the use of donor sperm raise a concern for accidental incest? The risk is increased by sperm from one donor being inseminated into many recipients. How is the “Jewishness” of such offspring determined? Egg Donation and Gestational Carriers–a View from the Field Rabbi Gideon Weitzman abstract Rabbinic authorities are debating who is the halakhic (Jewish legal) mother of a child born by gestational surrogacy, wherein one woman donated the ovum and another woman carried the pregnancy and gave birth. For instance, the author of this article differs in approach from two other authors in this volume. Torah-observant couples are availing themselves of the new technologies, and it is essential that they seek appropriate halakhic guidance and supervision before embarking on such assisted reproduction technologies. Medical and Halakhic Considerations in End-of-Life Care Barry M. Kinzbrunner abstract While Judaism teaches that life is of infinite value, Ecclesiastes tells us “…there is a time to live and a time to die…” Based on both Talmudic and Midrashic sources, we also learn that our patriarch Jacob asked G-d to create terminal illness in order allow us to have time to settle our affairs before death. Hence, there is a detailed account of his death in the last four chapters of Genesis. In spite of this, many rabbis are reluctant to allow patients under their consultation to access hospice services during the last phases of life. This is due to a number of barriers and misconceptions regarding how care is provided in a hospice program. Key barriers, including overall decision-making near the end of life, the management of pain, do-not-resuscitate orders versus cardiopulmonary resuscitation, and artificial nutrition and hydration, will be discussed from a medical perspective in order to show how they can be managed in ways consistent with medical halakhah, the extensive corpus of Jewish law dealing with health and the preservation of life. In Blessed Memory of Professor Jason Wolfe Yosef ben Avraham Isaac (1941–2014) A tribute by his wife, Professor Vera Schwarcz Jason Wolfe studied cell death out of a keen appreciation for life in all its forms. When he delivered this paper at the B’Or Ha’Torah conference in December 2013, only a few people there were aware of his serious illness (myelofibrosis, which is a cancer of the stem cells in the bone marrow). The audience did not know how much it had cost him to rush to the podium after days of delayed travel and exhaustion. Jason took his place among the distinguished physicians and rabbis  on the podium and within minutes delivered this lucid, informed, and at times even humorous paper about the marvelously effective mechanisms for programmed cell death which keep us alive, and which were at that very moment also hastening his own demise. Jason did not speak about his cancer. He chose, instead, to focus on what makes each of us deeply alive. In this conscious appreciation of human existence lay his nobility of spirit. A highly trained scientist, Jason also studied Torah with passion. His remarks for the conference were framed by two quotes from Jewish texts. The opening epigraph comes from Rabbi Shlomo Ha’Levi Alkabets’s Shabbat evening song “ Lekhah Dodi” : Arise and depart from amid the upheaval. The closing reference is from Psalms 116:9: I will walk before the L-rd in the lands of the living. Death of the Whole by Death of the Parts Professor Jason Wolfe Professor Jason Wolfe Based on a presentation at the Tenth Miami International Conference on Torah and Science, December 13–16, 2013 Abstract Whether an organism dies by accident, murder, disease, or old age, ultimately that death results from the death or malfunction of a sufficient number of cells that make up the organism, often cells in critical organs such as the brain or heart. For example, if an artery bringing blood to the heart becomes constricted or is torn, those heart cells that depend on the artery’s supply of oxygen and nutrients may die, possibly leading to the failure of the heart and death of the organism. Similarly, but for different reasons, cumulative cell death in the brain can lead to Parkinson’s disease, Alzheimer’s disease, and other forms of dementia. Surprisingly, most cells die by a mechanism that could almost be described as “voluntary.” Deprivation of nutrients triggers a molecular pathway that causes the cell to self-destruct by a mechanism that involves precise snipping of DNA into small pieces, the degradation of the cell’s internal skeletal system, outpouching of cell fragments, and the uptake and digestion of those fragments by neighboring cells. All multicellular organisms demonstrate this type of cell death; it is a well-conserved mechanism, involving the same genes and proteins. Moreover, the proteins involved in cell death are premanufactured in all cells. That means that the system, the pathway that leads to cell death, is already in place even in healthy cells and can be triggered instantaneously by the right signals. These facts suggest that regulation is essential for the life of an organism. That seems like a paradox; how could a mechanism that leads to cell death be essential for the life of the organism? Regulated cell death is Janus-like, contributing to the viability of an organism or to its death, depending on the circumstances. I shall describe the characteristics of regulated cell death, discuss the ways in which it is essential for the life of the organism, how it can save an organism from cancer, and how it can be triggered by faults in a cell and contribute to the death of an organism. Halakhah Meets DNA Fingerprinting Harvey Babich, PhD Harvey Babich, PhD This article originally appeared in slightly different form in Derech HaTeva: A Journal of Torah and Science , volume 19 (2014–2015), published by Stern College for Women of Yeshiva University. abstract Determination of the entire sequences of nitrogenous bases on DNA of nuclear chromosomes and on mitochondrial DNA was shown to be approximately 99.9 percent equivalent in cells from all human beings. The small variations that differ greatly among individuals serve as genetic markers to distinguish one person from another. Such variations arose from single-point mutations, accounting for single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), and from errors in DNA replications, accounting for copy number variants (CNVs). SNPs and CNVs arose in history, were transmitted to descendants, and serve as genetic markers. In the technique termed DNA fingerprinting, DNA is isolated from cells, purified, cut with restriction enzymes, separated according to size by DNA gel electrophoresis, and identified with probes. Forensic scientists use different probes to identify distinct DNA fragments, whose frequencies of occurrence are known within a population. The DNA fingerprint pattern that develops is unique and the chance of it matching two persons is about one in a trillion. DNA fingerprinting is used to identify cadavers and human remains resulting from natural catastrophes, military actions, and terrorist attacks, and has legal applications for certifying death certificates and wills, in the distribution of benefits to survivors, and in cases of an a gunah who is unsure of her marital status. DNA fingerprinting is not unique to humans, and has been used in the kashrut (kosher food) industry and to ascertain the purity of etrogim (citrons). Jews on Campus: A Crisis and an Opportunity Professor Cary Nelson Abstract Over the last few years, the long history of attempts to boycott or delegitimate the State of Israel have intensified with the rise of the Boycott, Divestment, and Sanctions (BDS) movement. Campuses in both North America and Europe have become centers of efforts to win students and faculty over to a view that demonizes the Jewish state. This has made rational and evidence-based conversations about the Israeli-Palestinian conflict difficult or impossible to sustain. Over the last year the campus atmosphere has become still more hostile as the accusations against Israel have been newly racialized. Too often anti-Israel faculty now feel justified in using the classroom to recruit students to their cause. All these developments make it difficult to promote the mutual respect and empathy required to understand the conflict and promote ways to resolve it. In response, people who support justice for both Israelis and Palestinians should use reasoned argument and rely on factual evidence, even if their opponents fail to do so. While a strong majority of Americans overall still offer Israel their support, campuses are increasingly graduating future professionals who do not. That represents a long-term threat to Israel’s special relationship with the US and its European trading partners. The Diamond Necklace Wendy Dickstein Now which gemara , which tractate of the Talmud, was it that discussed this matter? Kiddushin ? Ketubos ? He couldn't quite recall. He did remember, though, that it was a ma h lokes , one of those famous disputes among the Talmud Sages, about a woman who was three times a widow. She was known as a katlanis , a “killer.” He shuddered at the thought, and his hand rose instinctively to his throat. The dispute, as he recalled, was over whether she was to be considered a killer after the second husband died or only after the third. There were two opinions, but the upshot of the argument was, for all practical purposes, that a man should not take the chance of marrying such a woman. When he spoke about it the next evening during their nightly Talmud learning session to his dear friend and learning partner, Reb H aim Shlesinger, Reb H aim leapt out of his chair, knocking it over in his haste, and almost danced over to the bookshelf. He pulled out not one but two different volumes of the Talmud and opened the first one to the argument which Isaac had groped for in his memory the night before. Here it was, Tractate Yevamos . It was not exactly what Isaac had thought, at least not this particular discussion. But it answered his question perfectly. Comments by Rabbi Pinchas Kahn on “The Diamond Necklace” This story hinges upon the halakhic legality of marrying a woman whose two previous husbands have died. In practice, when interested in clarifying any such specific and applied law, one should go straight to the Shul h an A rukh, rather than merely looking up Maimonides’ opinion. The two scholars in the story would have better gone to a rabbinic authority conversant with the pertinent halakhic literature, who would have set their minds at rest. As they were evidently not equipped to clarify the law on their own, they should not have tried to resolve the issue by themselves. Bar Mitsvah and the Discovery of Self: The Blossoming of Human Consciousness in Halakhah and Kabbalah Rabbi Tzvi Freeman This invitation to researchers and scholars to explore the ideas in this article is based on a presentation at the Tenth Miami International Conference on Torah and Science, December 13–16, 2013. Sefer Yetsirah, the basis of Kabbalah, identifies nefesh (consciousness) as a building block of the universe, along with time and space. The Talmud Sages astutely determined puberty as the coming of age for social responsibility: age twelve for girls (bat mitsvah) and thirteen for boys (bar mitsvah). I propose that this is the stage of life when consciousness blossoms because this is when the internal dialogues of the mind begin to be heard. Language is necessary for the degree of reflective consciousness requisite for responsible action. The modality of da a t corresponds to the brain stem. It is suggested that the changes in the brain stem that trigger puberty also allow for the internal dialogue to become the heightened, almost visceral, experience that the Talmud recognizes as true human consciousness. I am not an expert in either cosmology or brain science. Therefore, this is not an academic paper but rather an invitation to experts in these fields to explore the ideas raised here.

A Few Observations on Epigenetics Professor Marvin Gold Specific segments of dna can be activated or silenced by an external epigene. Can epigenetic changes be passed on to the next generation? Can repentance and kindness that bring about true changes in behavior be considered a type of epigene? The Jewish Epigene Rabbi Sholom D. Lipskar Torah action is the epigene that G-d gave the Jewish People. Genetically, Jews are like all other peoples. Generations of performing Torah commandments have helped create a unique behavior pattern that functions beyond the genetic structure but impacts on it. We have to keep on renewing the positive behavior, though, for the epigene to continue working. Our collective and personal will — expressed in the hayyah level of our souls — must keep on driving us to be different for our own good and for that of all humankind. Based on a presentation at the Tenth Miami International Conference on Torah and Science, December 13–16, 2013 A Fresh Look at Genesis Professor Joseph S. Bodenheimer In an approach differing from those of Professors Nathan Aviezer, Gerald Schroeder, the late Benjamin Fain , and others who have written about Genesis from a scientist’s perspective, we propose an interpretation of the Creation chapters that follows the Torah text very closely and finds within it a dialogue between G-d and nature, as suggested by the commentary of Na h manides. Three acts of creation were performed ex nihilo, where natural substance could not develop into a higher form. These acts of creation, yesh me’ a yin, occurred on Day One, Day Five, and Day Six: the first appearance of the universe itself, the first appearance of living creatures, and the appearance of Adam and Eve in the image of G-d. Presented at the Tenth Miami International Conference on Torah and Science, December 13–16, 2013 From Spinoza to Hawking: Analysis and Critique Professor Nathan Aviezer There are philosophers and scientists who claim that nothing exists except the physical universe. They assert that what cannot be observed does not exist. This idea appears in the 1774 treatise Ethics by the philosopher Baruch Spinoza, as well as in the 1796 treatise Exposition of the System of the World by mathematician-astronomer Pierre-Simon Laplace. This idea has again been proclaimed by cosmologist Stephen Hawking in his recent book, The Grand Design , which presents his new theory for the spontaneous beginning of the universe. He generalizes Big Bang cosmology to include String Theory, Inflationary Cosmology, and Quantum Theory. Hawking concludes that “G-d is unnecessary because the creation of the universe follows directly from the laws of physics.” Hawking’s new book became an instant best seller, to the delight of the atheists. Richard Dawkins gloats, “Darwin kicked G-d out of biology, and now Hawking has administered the coup de grace .” I shall point out the error in the claims of Dawkins and Hawking, and show that there is harmony between the new discoveries and traditional Torah concepts. Presented at the Tenth Miami International Conference on Torah and Science, December 13–16, 2013 The Physician's Prayer Rabbi Professor Avraham Steinberg, MD I compiled this prayer from prayers composed by physicians who preceded me and adapted it to our times to serve as an ethical code from a Torah and halakhic perspective. As a segulah (spiritual remedy), this edited English translation of the longer Hebrew prayer is recommended to be recited once a week to help physicians know their place and responsibilities toward the A-lmighty, their patients, and their colleagues. Both the short and long prayers in Hebrew appear in the Encyclopedia of Jewish Medical Ethics, second Hebrew edition, 2006, vol. I, mavo A:29-36. The full text of previous prayers by and for physicians can be found in the Encyclopedia of Jewish Medical Ethics, pp. 16-29. Like a Stone: Scientific and Halakhic Solutions to the Eighth-Month Infant Phenomenon Estie Neff Clashes between science and religion have existed for centuries and still exist today, particularly affecting many aspects of health care, from birth control to blood transfusions. Halakhah , the laws extrapolated from the Torah that govern the daily life of a Jew, can sometimes be in conflict with science as well. A prime example is the Talmudic prohibition on caring for an infant born in the eighth month of gestation. The Talmud forbids a mother from holding or feeding her newborn eighth-month baby on Shabbat, even if this may cause premature death. This halakhah is based on the widely held belief that eighth-month infants are not viable, while seventh- and ninth-month infants are. Yet, today we know from medical science that a baby born in its eighth month is more viable than a baby born in its seventh month. Furthermore, advances in medical science make it possible today for premature babies to survive at a much higher rate than when the Talmud was compiled. Since the facts upon which this halakhah is based are simply not relevant anymore, several halakhic authorities have responded to this challenge. Eventually, modern-day halakhic authorities permitted care for eighth-month babies on Shabbat. The origin of this halakhah and its eventual adaptation to new physical realities are fascinating topics that ultimately strengthen the connection between Torah and the Jewish people. Hemophilia in Jewish Traditions and Genomes Samuel Reisman Over the past century, the congruency between the modern description of hemophilia and a hereditary coagulation disorder described in the Talmud has been widely noted. Examination of the Talmudic text suggests that: The disease described there closely resembles the modern characterization of classic hemophilia. The hereditary pattern described is consistent with the distinctive inheritance pattern of chromosome-x lined recessive genetic disorders. An empirical basis for the observation of this disorder, as well as its inheritance patterns, was plausibly supplied by the Jewish practice of ritual circumcision, which facilitated a universal hematological evaluation of all males. A corresponding pre-modern report of hemophilia from a Muslim surgeon is harmonious with this description. The Talmudic description of hemophilia in subsequent rabbinic writings, notably the description of hemophilia as possibly paternally inherited, are coherent in light of the etiology and progression of factor xi deficiency, which is uniquely prevalent among Jewish populations and is associated with chromosome 4, an autosome. Hemorrhage following circumcision can also result from non-genetic diseases caused by spontaneous mutations arising during gametogenesis. These scenarios help to clarify the rationale behind the Talmudic requirement of multiple presentations to affirm a hereditary danger. Scientific Content in Jewish Sources Professor N.S.

Heshbon Ha'Nefesh for the Twenty-First Century Rabbi Joel Padowitz, MBA, CFA Rabbis from Talmudic times until today have stressed the importance of regular h eshbon ha’nefesh (self-examination). To the extent that there is a uniform method employed in the Jewish world today, it is the one described in the nineteenth century work Sefer H eshbon Ha’Nefesh . In this paper, I shall explore the surprising origins of the technique presented in Sefer H eshbon Ha’Nefesh . Then, applying a contemporary school of psychological thought known as Constructive-Developmental Theory (CDT), I shall clarify why the “classic” method is inadequate in addressing certain self-development goals.  I shall describe a technique known as the Immunity to Change Map (ITCM) and explain why a hybrid approach that combines the technique described in Sefer H eshbon Ha’Nefesh with the ITCM is not only more effective for achieving lasting change, but also more consistent with traditional Jewish thought. I hope that my suggested hybrid approach will encourage and inspire readers to attempt this enhanced form of h eshbon ha’nefesh. National and Personal Melancholy in the Writings of Yehuda Halevi Kenneth Collins, MBCHB, MPhil, PhD, FRCGP Although a celebrated Hebrew poet whose output covered many genres, and a successful physician, Rabbi Yehudah Halevi (1075-1141 CE) suffered extreme sorrow over the persecution of the Jewish People by both Christians and Muslims and their exile from the Land of Israel. His poetry conveys his longing for Israel and his distress at the Jewish condition in the lands of their dispersal. Taking great risks, he finally traveled to the Holy Land to seek G-d’s Presence there, but legend has it that he was killed at the gates of Jerusalem. An early version of this paper was presented in July 2011 at a conference on Poetry and Melancholy at the University of Stirling, Scotland. The Sanctification of Art Esther Cameron, PhD This article addresses the question how art, especially poetry, should be regarded and practiced in a Jewish milieu. In the Western tradition, which has also influenced modern Hebrew poetry, art has been associated with quasi-idolatrous and amoral tendencies, and as a result is often regarded as “unsanctified.” On the other hand, art, especially poetry, has also served to keep people in touch with their inwardness, and the declining readership of poetry is one of the symptoms of modern man’s self-alienation. The ambiguous role of poetry is rooted in the dual nature of poetic inspiration, which corresponds to the duality of the divine and the animal soul as described in the Tanya . But tshuvah (repentance) subordinates the animal soul to the Divine soul, and a poetry of tshuvah was envisioned by Rabbi Abraham Isaac Kook as part of the Jewish national revival. The Art of Listening: Jewish and Chinese Views of Aging Professor Vera Schwarcz At fifteen, I set my heart on learning… At seventy I followed what my heart desired without transgressing the line. Confucius, “The Analects” At fifteen the study of Talmud… At seventy, fullness of years… Mishnah Avot 5:22 Thinking comparatively about the beginning and the end of life can enrich our understanding of both cultural and biological paradigms for optimal survival. This paper draws upon key themes in Confucian and Jewish tradition to illustrate different strategies for mapping a person’s journey from life to death. In the process, we shall find radically different definitions of “learning,” “wisdom,” “accomplishment,” and “failure.” To suggest, as the Zohar and the Tanya do, that the ending is embedded in the beginning will be shown to be a key insight for Confucian thought as well. The journey from life to death is not one of devolution but an act of radical return that gives meaning and depth to each stage traversed by the individual—and the human community as a whole. Neither Judaism nor Confucianism limited its definitions of “life” and “death” to its culture alone. Each offers distinctive angles of vision upon a broadly human predicament that knows no temporal or geographical bounds. In both cultural traditions the successful completion of the human journey depends upon discovering and accepting the limitations that ethics imposes upon individual behavior. Knowing and staying “within the bounds” will be shown to be key to genuine transcendence. Presented at the Tenth Miami International Conference on Torah and Science, December 13–16, 2013 Good Dogs and Bad Dogs in Jewish Law Professor Fred Rosner, MD, MACP Did the Talmud Sages restrict the conditions for raising only dangerous dogs, or do the restrictions apply also to tame pets? Most halakhic adjudicators rule that the restrictions are on all dogs, while other authorities maintain that the restrictions are only on dangerous, frightening dogs. Jewish law infers from the Torah that animals in our possession should be fed before we ourselves sit down to eat. Although normally we are not allowed to handle a dog on Shabbat, blind people are allowed to use a Seeing Eye dog, even on Shabbat and even in the synagogue. The Inside Story of the Founding of Jewish Meditation Rabbi Yehoshua Landes In the 1970s when Rabbi Mena h em Mendel Schneerson, the Lubavitcher Rebbe, saw that Transcendental Meditation helped relieve stress for many people, he called for Jewish medical professionals to develop a scientific form of meditation free of idolatrous influence. The Rebbe’s aim was to help Jews suffering from anxiety and depression. He believed that healthy Jews should actively reach out to the world through observing the Torah and not retreat into the seclusion of meditation, which could make even mentally healthy people ill. Therefore the Rebbe wanted a new type of meditation that would be a limited medical treatment. He did not want this therapy to be a form of Jewish religious, H asidic, or mystical outreach. Dr. Yehuda Landes, a psychologist in Palo Alto, was one of the few to respond to the Rebbe’s call; his son, Rabbi Yehoshua Landes, using the complete correspondence between his father and the Rebbe, recounts here how Jewish Meditation was founded. Rabbi Landes makes a call of his own for mum h im , rabbinic experts, to study and adjudicate the many forms of meditation and yoga with Jewish orientation that abound today.

Communicable Memory, Eternal Memory, Brain Malfunction, and Us Rabbi Sholom D. Lipskar Biologically, the inability to recall memories or the distortion of memory is the result of faulty mechanisms that cannot successfully translate memory into communication. I suggest that successfully communicated memory is what our sages called “memory in the mouth” (that can be verbally shared). But there is also an everlasting source of memory in the soul that our sages called “memory in the heart.” When we interact with people whose brains malfunction, the memory of their hearts (their souls) is in full function and is reacting internally to our behavior with them. The names of the people in the anecdotal account have been changed. Editor’s note: Rabbi Lipskar’s keynote lecture was the definitive presentation at the Ninth Miami International Conference, defining the levels of the human soul. It is a necessary introduction to the other articles in this volume discussing the soul, mind, and brain. The Life-Long Study of the Individual—the Halakhic and Biological Stages of Life Rabbi Professor Moshe D. Tendler This paper discusses the halakhic categorization of the stages of human life. As we age we can realize our full potential, if we integrate the knowledge we accumulate throughout a lifetime with our physical and biological existence ( nefesh ), guided always by halakhic imperatives. The Biological Interface of the Brain and the Soul Rabbi Professor Avraham Steinberg, MD Is there a biological interface between the brain and the soul? In order to address this question, I shall touch on three major issues: The neurobiology, including relevant neuro-anatomy and neuro-physiology, of the physical brain Genetics and free will The views of science and Judaism on the possible interrelationship of the brain with the mind, morality, and the soul There is no scientific explanation for higher cortical functions such as free will, morality, faith, and other metaphysical phenomena. The Spiritual Brain: It, I, and Thou Dr.  Kenneth M. Heilman Religiosity can be defined as a specific system of doctrines, shared by a group of people with prescribed rules, value systems, dogma, and practices. In contrast, spirituality is a transcendental belief system or an experiential state, including the belief in the divine, as well as the beliefs that life has meaning and that there are forms of universal harmony and unity. The brain mechanisms that mediate spiritual experiences are not entirely known, and this paper proposes and discusses how spirituality may be related to several brain mechanisms, including left-hemisphere mediated agent detection; sensory isolation with imagery; hallucinations and activation of the default network; as well as the knowledge of our own mortality, the activation of limbic-cortical networks that mediate the fear-dread associated with this knowledge, and how faith may reduce this pain Stress, Memory, and Meaning Yakir Kaufman, MD Stress is a risk factor for almost every disease. Research also shows that loss of meaning in life is a major risk factor. These factors are associated with brain impairment and Alzheimer's disease. Health is defined as the enhancement of well-being, including physical, social, psychological, and spiritual well-being. Thousands of studies have shown that spiritual well-being is associated with better health or longevity. Therefore lowering stress levels, by enhancing spiritual well-being and meaning in life, may prevent and help alleviate Alzheimer's disease. It has been found that Alzheimer's disease has a prominent vascular component. The Torah teaches us this in various ways, including in the account of the arch-villain A malek. The name A malek means \"to behead,\" to disconnect the (warm) blood supply from the heart to the brain. The commandment to both remember and obliterate A malek can be interpreted in h asidic terms as the need for us to dispel the coldness and doubt of the archetypal A malek within ourselves, thus allowing an adequate warm flow of the blood supply from the heart to the brain and protecting us from possible brain impairment. Repressed Memory and Holocaust Survivors Rabbi Professor Daniel Hershkowitz In many written testimonies given to Yad Vashem through the decades by Holocaust survivors, the memory of children who were killed is blocked because it is too terrible to bear. There are survivors who testified about their parents and other close and distant relatives but who could not testify about their children. It is almost impossible for the human mind to accept such unexpected and unacceptable painful losses. This anecdotal essay looks for the lesson in life that can we learn about accepting unexpected realities. From Memory to Oblivion? The Future of the Holocaust Professor Oren Baruch Stier It is generally assumed that remembering the Holocaust is an ethical obligation incumbent upon every Jew, survivors and non-survivors alike. But what is the specific nature of that obligation? And how is it met as survivors age and pass away, as memories fail, or spokespeople grow tired? How does one confront the increased urgency of remembering the Shoah “before it is too late”? What, indeed, is the relationship between memory and forgetting, remembrance and oblivion? Is there a moral obligation to remember? To forget? This article examines the notion of memorial responsibility against its presumed opposite, oblivion, in the context of a Torah perspective on memorialization in general. Utilizing material gleaned from literature, memoir, and philosophy, including the writings of Primo Levi, Avishai Margalit, and Elie Wiesel, it presents a snapshot of the present, as living memory passes into history and culture. My aim is to assess what is lost or gained in this process of memorial transformation with which society is currently engaged. The Jewish View on Caring for Aging Parents Leah Abramowitz In our generation, some think that it has become more difficult for adult children to tend to their aging parents. With the increase in life expectancy, many elderly become ill and dependent for years. The wise and surprisingly “modern” teachings of the Jewish sages can be a source of guidance for distraught offspring trying to handle these problems. Pirkei Avot, Brain Plasticity, and Self-Renewal Daniel Drubach One of the premier postulates of Judaism is that humans have been given the ability and responsibility to perpetually re-create themselves.This constant re-creation requires an efficient methodology. Such a system is magnificently delineated by the Mishnah Avot, known as Pirkei Avot or The Ethics of the Fathers. Specifics of this methodology are very much in line with recent discoveries in neuroscience that explain how the brain is re-created in harmony with changes in the self. We shall describe two processes: behavioral plasticity and theory of mind as examples of tools for self-brain renewal. We also introduce the topic of function-specific cellular assemblies and their relationship to changes in the self-brain unit. The Lubavitcher Rebbe’s Call for  a Scientific Non-Hasidic Meditation Rabbi Natan Ophir (Offenbacher) In February 1978, Rabbi Menahem Mendel Schneerson (the Lubavitcher Rebbe) sent out a confidential memorandum asking for “doctors specializing in neurology and psychiatry” to develop a meditation program that could serve as an alternative for the popular meditative imports from the Far East such as Transcendental Meditation (TM). Dr. Yehuda Landes, a psychologist in Palo Alto, California, responded positively and soon launched a pilot project. Then in July 1979, the Rebbe issued a public announcement asking for more people to help in developing and disseminating a Jewishly acceptable form of meditation. Meanwhile, Rabbi Aryeh Kaplan, together with a group of Jewish psychiatrists and psychologists, was exploring meditative techniques from kabbalistic and ħasidic sources. However, the Rebbe directed Landes not to utilize Aryeh Kaplan’s meditations but rather to develop a non-hasidic, scientifically based meditation. In this article we examine the context of the Rebbe’s correspondence and analyze his request by comparing it to the scientific meditative techniques being developed in the 1970s. We conclude by noting the implications for modern Jewish meditation. Our Talmud Sages’ Knowledge of Nature Professor Joseph S. Bodenheimer The sages of the Talmud had an evidence-based approach to nature and a positive attitude to experimental observation. They derived information from any resource available to them, whether it was friendly or unfriendly, as long as it was reliable, and applied it to halakhic decisions, according to their knowledge and understanding of Torah. Benjamin Fain’s The Poverty of Secularism versus Richard Dawkins’ The G-d Delusion Professor Benjamin Fain My book, The Poverty of Secularism (Fain 2012), contains a clear and detailed response to the extreme physicalist worldview presented in Richard Dawkins’ book, The God Delusion (Dawkins 2008). I could have simply made these comments in the body of that book. However, Dawkins’ book, in which he misleads readers by his mistaken assertion that there is a scientific rationale to his atheistic view, has become a bestseller. therefore, I have decided to respond to the principal claims presented in his book. Jews and Genes Professor Harvey Babich Ayelet R. Bersson Tehilla Brander Within the past fifteen years, several studies have focused on the genetic relatedness amongst Jews, particularly of those geographically separated from each other. Analyses of DNA markers on mitochondrial DNA (for studies of maternal lineage), on the Y chromosome (for studies of paternal lineage), and on other nuclear chromosomal DNA (for studies of the entire genome) have indicated: (a) Jews are closer to each other genetically than to non-Jews from the same geographic region; (b) Jews share a common set of genetic markers of the larger Jewish population indicative of shared ancestry traced to the Middle East; and (c) Jews show admixture with non-Jewish populations. This last finding corroborates a talmudic passage (Psaħim 87b) that one of the opportunities of the Jewish nation in exile is to welcome and accept sincere converts. In addition, linkage amongst Jews was indicated by genetic diseases, some of which are specific for particular communities. Reference is made to Tay-Sachs disease, which may reflect an interesting aspect of heterozygote advantage. Lastly, as Jews eventually take on the outer appearances of the peoples of their host countries, there may be no distinctive Jewish phenotype. Reasons for this may include environmental selection, epigenetics, and admixture. Preimplantation Genetic Diagnosis (PGD) and Prenatal Gender Selection Idit Goldberg and Rachel Shandrovsky One of the possibilities for performing genetic family programming is preimplantation genetic diagnosis (PGD). PGD has been successfully applied to cure infertility and to eliminate fatal genetic diseases in the embryonic stage. Are we permitted by halakhah (Jewish law) to use PGD for gender selection? Let’s say a family has four boys and they want a girl. They don’t want to take another chance. By using PGD the family can select the gender of their choice. Is it halakhically permissible to select a certain gender for non-medical purposes? Passing within the Field of View of Thermal Sensors that Activate Electric Lights on Shabbat Merav Yust Renanah Altman According to halakhah (Jewish law) the activation of an electric circuit on Shabbat violates the Torah prohibition of boneh . Prima facie, however, passing in front of an infrared sensor does not constitute boneh. Activating an infrared sensor that turns on an incandescent light is forbidden on account of the scriptural prohibition of havarah . However, if the sensor activates an LED (light-emitting diode) or a mercury-vapor lamp, then activating the sensor violates a rabbinic prohibition only (excluding the opinion of the Hazon Ish that creating an electric circuit violates the scriptural prohibition of boneh, which does not apply in this case. When a person triggers an electronic system by entering the sensor’s field of view, the system is activated without the need of a mediating factor . According to the view of Rashi, this action therefore does not count as grama (indirect action).

Designing Babies—Halakhic Perspectives Rabbi Professor Avraham Steinberg, MD Jews are not only allowed to intervene with nature to heal, they are required to do so. The new technologies that have been developed to avoid genetic diseases in babies before and after they are born fall into the category of healing. New biotechnologies have been developed to reduce the incidence of genetic diseases such as Tay Sachs, cystic fibrosis, and Huntington’s disease. Pre-implantation Genetic Diagnosis (PGD) in a family with a history of a genetic disease allows a couple to produce healthy children by selecting embryos that do not carry the genes responsible for those diseases. The theological and practical halakhic ramifications of pre-implantation genetic diagnosis, genetic engineering, and genetic therapy will be discussed. The Power to Predict: Using DNA Technologies to Assess the Genetics and Health of a Fetus Professor John D. Loike Genetic testing of a fetus is another method that can be used to help select for healthy babies, but the issue of pregnancy termination raises a halakhic barrier against using this technology among Torah-observant Jews. New genetic fetal testing technology is currently under development that may lead to the ability to screen a fetus for genetic diseases within the first forty days, when most halakhic authorities would allow termination. Using case studies, I shall discuss the newest scientific achievements in these areas within a halakhic framework. Behavioral Genetics and Free Will—on a Collision Course? Rabbi Professor Moshe D. Tendler Is a person carrying a gene that predisposes him to aggression, addiction, or kleptomania responsible for his behavior? Although there are both halakhic and biological cases in which a person is not responsible for his behavior, God gave us free will and with it the power to overcome any genetic predisposition. Who Owns Genetic and Other Medical Information?  The Jewish View Professor Fred Rosner, MD, MACP Who owns the genetic information obtained about a person’s health and health prospects from the family history or by direct genetic testing: the patients, the family, the laboratory that performed the testing, society, insurance companies, or some or all of the above? Resolution of a Two-millennia-old Talmudic Mathematical Conundrum Professor Isaac Elishakoff In 1985 Robert Aumann and Michael Maschler published a paper using the mathematics of Game Theory to explain the enigmatic rulings in the mishnah of Ketubot, chap. 10, mishnah 4, about dividing an inadequate estate between the three wives of the same husband. (Aumann and Maschler 1985) This allocation of resources problem had puzzled sages and mathematicians for 2,000 years. They showed that the reasoning in this mishnah is consistent with that used in the well-known contested garment mishnah ( Bava Metsi a, chap.1 mishnah 1), for each pair of wives separately. In this paper I show that the reasoning is much more straightforward when we group the three wives into two “coalitions:” The problem of how to allocate the marriage contract rights to the three widows is directly reduced to the second ruling of the contested garment case. Furthermore, there is no need to postulate that “more than half is like the whole.” In this manner one can reconstruct systematically the thinking of the author of this mishnah. The Marriage Contract Distribution Problem— a Solution from the Jerusalem Talmud Professor Joseph S. Bodenheimer The Jerusalem Talmud (Ketubot, chap. 10, halakhah 4) on the enigmatic ruling of the Mishnah regarding the allocations to marriage contracts of three wives, cites Shmuel’s opinion that this ruling can be explained by the third wife’s empowering the second wife to negotiate with the first wife. This approach has been discussed by Aumann and Maschler in their celebrated paper on the subject. I suggest a broader understanding of Shmuel’s explanation as cited in the Jerusalem Talmud, which consists of a novel approach to the overall problem. Encouraging Honesty—Discouraging Fraud: Matters for Discussion Raphael Yehezkael This discussion article presents an attempt to encourage honesty and reduce fraud and theft. It is is based on section 6 in \"Linkage not Interest—Wages not Prices\" and in \"Interest Free Wage Linkage of Personal Loans and Mortgages\" at http://homedir.jct.ac.il/~rafi , where other works of mine can be found. Was Reuben an Oedipal Winner? Fathers and Sons: Jacob and Reuben Judith Sandra Bendheim Guedalia In this paper, our focal points are the biblical scenarios in which Reuben, Jacob’s oldest son, acts in a way that indicates that unresolved Oedipal issues are very much alive in his adult psychic life. The story of Reuben highlights that winning the Oedipal war may cause a lifetime of complication and developmental paralysis. In Reuben’s case, his position as the leader of the Twelve Tribes by virtue of his firstborn status is seriously damaged. This wound seems to affect not only him, but also his descendants for a considerable period of Jewish history. Through the application of psychological theory, along with an exegesis of biblical sources and commentaries, we try to understand the psychological dynamics underlying Reuben’s behavior, and his own attempts to resolve this unfortunate and painful dynamic. The Youtai Jewish Spark in China Professor Vera Schwarcz This essay explores a few key themes in the complex process through which Jews translated their creed and identity in the cultural setting of China. Building upon Rabbi Abraham Isaac Kook’s vision of “sparks” abounding with treasure in nations and individuals alike, I trace Chinese naming practices as well as some turning points in Chinese-Jewish history from the Song dynasty through the twentieth century. Current interest in China about Jews and Jewish studies is placed in a larger quest for rooted modernity —the distinctive achievements of utterly modern Jews. The small yet path-breaking a liyah of the descendants of the Chinese Jews to Israel is shown to be part of a larger history that links backward in time to the lost tribes and forward to a redemptive vision of the ingathering of Jewish sparks from all over the world. Book Review Professor Joseph S. Bodenheimer Professor Benjamin Fain (world-class chemist in the fields of quantum electronics, lasers, and condensed matter) shows that the world in which we live—including us human beings as a crucial and inseparable part of it—cannot be explained and understood within the limits and concepts of secularism. In order to reach this conclusion, the author explores the essential realms of human culture such as science, philosophy, ethics, cosmogony (the study of the formation of the universe), cosmology, and theories of the development of life and humankind by evolution. These and other topics are the object of meticulous scrutiny, which reveals the incompleteness and shortcomings of secularism as a worldview. About Our Artists Yael Avi-Yonah was born in Jerusalem and graduated from the Bezalel Academy of Art. Her father, Michael Avi-Yonah—the distinguished archaeologist and historian, and head of the Department of the History of Art at the Hebrew University—provided her with the rich background in art, archeology, and Bible which emanates from her works. Thousands of her prints and serigraphs on Jerusalem landscapes and biblical subjects have been sold throughout the world. Her series of oil portraits of fifteen major contemporary Israeli authors was exhibited at the Jerusalem International Book Fair in 1984 and abroad. In 1987 she completed a series of paintings on the Twelve Tribes for the Yad L’Mordekhai synagogue in Jerusalem. She has appeared in Who’s Who in Israel , and her works were given to the homes of the great kabbalistic master, Rabbi Yitshak Kadori, of blessed memory, and the Dalai Lama. Since 1988, she has been working in anaglyphic art . Her themes are inspired by Jewish mysticism and include the four angels of the Divine Chariot, and the four kabbalistic worlds, Jerusalem in the messianic age, and visions of the Third Temple. Recently, she has completed a series of collages on metal, which she calls hologramic energies . These works can be viewed in various ways: with or without special glasses that input to the right and left sides of the brain, or as a hologram. Her works are on display in the Jewish Museum in London, as well as galleries and museums in Israel and abroad. Just as her earlier work of archeological drawings and realistic portrait painting reflected her humanistic background, her current recondite work revealing energy patterns and spiritual truths reflects her now Torah-centered life. What caused the turn? At one point of her life, she says, “I decided to find out how the world is put together.” Yael Avi-Yonah’s work can be seen on her website: www.yaelavi-yonah.com. Soilless Agriculture: from Shmittah Observance to Outer Space Professor Meier Schwarz Methods of soilless cultivation of plants were developed by Meier Schwarz. His goal was to find an alternative way to raise crops in Israel that would enable observance of the Torah command of shmittah , every seventh year to let the land rest. These methods became widely adopted in Israel and throughout the world. In this article, Part One relates Schwarz’s life story; Part Two describes his career in developing soilless agriculture; Part Three explains what hydroponics is; and the Appendix highlights some of his experiences as the Haganah commander of one of the ships forced to return to Germany with refugees from the ship Exodus . The text of all four parts was adapted by Ilana Attia from Mi’Dor L’Dor: Meier u’Miriam Schwarz , an autobiography written in Hebrew in 2005 for Schwarz’s children and grandchildren, and from Soilless Culture Management (1995:Berlin: Springer-Verlag), Schwarz’s summary of hydroponics.

His father, Eliezer Schwarz—a pillar of the Jewish community, the Adas Israel synagogue (later burned on Kristallnacht), and its charity institutions—was murdered by Nazis in the street in 1937. Deprived of medicines because she was Jewish, his mother died in a hospital in 1940. His only brother, Joseph, was exterminated in Auschwitz in 1943. While still in Nuremberg, Joseph managed to send Meier in a youth transport to Palestine, where he was enrolled in the Horev school in Jerusalem in 1939. In 1941, Meier joined other young Jews from Germany (most of them orphaned by the Nazis) to establish Kibbuts Hafets Hayyim, south of Rehovot. Under spartan conditions, the young pioneers worked hard, maintained the traditions of German Jewry, and set aside time to learn Torah every evening. Part of their strict Torah observance was a meticulous performance of the mitsvot for Jews living in the Land of Israel, including tithing Jewish-grown local produce each time before eating it. Only the strictest observant Jews at the time in Palestine observed these mitsvot connected to the Land. When Schwarz started experimenting with hydroponics as a method to let the land rest every seventh (shmittah) year, people both within and outside his kibbuts refused to take it seriously. Before he had a chance to develop his methods of soilless agriculture, Schwarz volunteered from 1946 to 1947 in the Haganah. He was sent to Europe to help smuggle the surviving remnants of European Jewry out of displaced persons’ refugee camps onto clandestine Haganah boats. In 1952, Meier and Miriam Schwarz married in a small ceremony at Hafets Hayyim. The first three of their seven children were born there. During the 1950s, in his free time after work, Schwarz started cultivating lettuce and radishes without organic soil. In 1960, the Schwarz family left Hafets Hayyim to enable Meier to fully pursue his work on soilless plant cultivation and to get a university education. At age thirty-four, still without a high school diploma or matriculation, Schwarz started his university studies. During his years of study, he taught at various high schools and conducted research. From 1960 to 1967, he was one of the chief researchers at the Institute for Negev Research in Beersheba. Experimentation on soilless agriculture in Beersheba, early 1950’s. Some of Meier Schwarz’s soilless agriculture experiments in Beersheba in the 1950’s. In 1966, he started teaching Talmud and biology at Bar-Ilan University. In 1969, he was invited to research the use of waste water at Hadassah Hospital. In 1970, he was invited by the Jerusalem College for Women to establish its natural sciences department, which he directed until 1982. In 1972, he participated in a UN delegation of agricultural scientists to the Far East. He was appointed the national supervisor of high-school biology studies in Israel in 1973. From 1978 to 1984, he conducted research at the Hebrew University, where he completed his doctorate in botany in 1983. In 1984 Schwarz served as a research coordinator for the Jerusalem College of Technology. Professor Schwarz has published ninety scientific articles in professional publications. He has authored three technical books in English and two in Hebrew, plus six educational booklets in Hebrew and numerous Hebrew articles on shmittah, the Hebrew calendar, German Jewry, and various Torah and science topics. He has participated in many international conferences on soilless agriculture and its applications in outer space. In his many travels throughout the world as an agricultural consultant, Schwarz returned to Germany a number of times. In 1986 he became the director of Beit Ashkenaz to research the 1,750 synagogues in Germany destroyed by the Nazis on Kristallnacht in 1938. This project, which has resulted in the publication of eight books of commemoration so far, now occupies most of his time. Although his childhood family and community were cruelly destroyed, Meier Schwarz is perpetuating the memory of their deep roots."

B'OR HA'TORAH 20 B'OR HA'TORAH 20 $10 via PayPal - International Shipping $5 via PayPal - PDF only Is population growth a blessing or a curse? Daniel Hershkowitz—Israel’s Minister of Science and Technology, Technion professor of mathematics, and community rabbi—shows us that the balancing forces of nature controlling animal populations are mirrored in the human soul. ∞ Surveying the history of “doomsayer” and “cornucopian” views on human overpopulation, ecologist Akiva Wolff, PhD, suggests that a wise application of the Torah principle of bal tashhit can bridge the two positions. ∞ In an exclusive report to B’OR HA’TORAH, Rabbi Professor Avraham Steinberg, MD, describes how and why he steered the public committees that drafted the halakhically compatible laws in the Knesset regarding Patient’s Rights, Stem Cell Research, the Dying Patient, and Brain Death. ∞ Another international authority on Jewish medical ethics, Professor Fred Rosner, MD, examines the types of emergency treatments that Jewish doctors and dentists are permitted to perform on Shabbat. ∞ The permissibility of using computers, microphones, and chemical cooking kits on Shabbat is explored by Bar-Ilan university graduate students in a new format for BHT—poster papers. ∞ Comfortably fitting into India’s caste system enabled the Jews in south-western India to retain a strong Jewish identity, yet the attitudes among different strata of Jews created a contradiction with halakhah. Professor Nathan Katz analyzes a brilliant and compassionate sixteenth-century responsum by the Radbaz to the Jews of Cochin concerning the acceptance of converts. B’OR HA’TORAH JOURNAL OF SCIENCE, LIFE AND ART IN THE LIGHT OF THE TORAH A peer-reviewed journal on the interrelationship of Judaism, science and technology, psychology, the arts, and social issues, B’Or Ha’Torah illuminates a range of topics from the cosmology and ecology of Genesis; the creation ex nihilo vs. evolution and faith vs. reason debates; the views of halakhah (Jewish law) on stem cell research and genetic engineering; and the soul-mind-brain-memory-body connection. Rabbis and religious Jews with no science background as well as professionals in all fields with no Torah background can enjoy this inspiring publication in hardcopy and digital formats.

Mathematical Stability in Our Personal Lives Rabbi Professor Daniel Hershkowitz Stability of movement is achieved by stabilizing forces working in the reverse direction. One of the many examples of the use of this principle in technology is the small wings of a rocket. This principle is also widely used in economics. The mathematics of stabilizing forces was developed by Alfred J. Lotka and Vito Volterra, working independently of one another. Studying predator-prey systems in nature helped Lotka to develop his model. Human nature has a stabilizing force implanted by God. Our rabbis teach us that the evil inclination of every person pushes him or her in the reverse direction, similar to stabilizing forces, demanding intuitive mathematics in order to find the right balance. The Principle of Bal Tashhit as an Explanatory Tool for Resolving the Conflict between Cornucopians and Doomsayers Akiva Wolff, PhD Bal tashhit is the environmental Torah commandment that prohibits the needless destruction of anything useful to human life. It is derived from the prohibition in Deuteronomy 20:19–20 against destroying fruit trees during a wartime siege. “Cornucopians” (also called “anti-Malthusians”) is a name given to those who believe that through human innovation the world can provide a practically limitless abundance of natural resources. “Doomsayers” ( also called “Malthusians” ) is a name given to those who believe that all or some of humankind are doomed by human population growth and/or high consumption rates and their effects on the environment. The principle of bal tashḥit can play a useful explanatory role in resolving the debate between these two opposing points of view. Only with the production and maintenance of the full spectrum of knowledge, moral-ethical behavior, and the necessary institutional infrastructure for maintaining them can there be sustainable human progress. I suggest that a Torah-true lifestyle, with an emphasis on the observance of bal tashḥit, is a method par excellence for promot ing human progress with sustainability. This article is part of the author’s PhD thesis. The $10 Billion Accelerator in Geneva:  What Can We Learn from It? Professor Nathan Aviezer The CERN (European Organization for Nuclear Research) accelerator in Geneva is the largest, most sophisticated, and most expensive scientific facility ever constructed. It is situated in a huge underground doughnut-shaped structure, eighteen miles long and fifty feet high, packed with complicated scientific apparatus, and it will cost almost ten billion dollars. An accelerator is an instrument for producing new particles. Particles are the building blocks of all matter in the universe. Why is it so important to produce new particles? What is the connection between this new accelerator and the Torah? Some of the currently outstanding problems of physics are the elusive Higgs particle, dark matter, and string theory. This paper puts the Geneva venture in the context of a Torah perspective. I shall explain in simple language how the Geneva accelerator is expected to shed important light on these topics and perhaps on other fundamental questions of science, thus deepening our appreciation of God’s Creation. Cosmic Background Radiation:  Does the Rakia (Firmament) Separate Matter from Antimatter? David B. Medved, PhD This posthumous paper develops comparisons and analogies between modern astrophysics and the Torah account of the first and second Days of Creation. The approach is similar to the well-known Day-Age model, which posits that each Day of the six days of Genesis corresponds to a specific epoch in the evolution of the Universe from t=0 to the present era. The manuscript was edited by Professor Joseph S. Bodenheimer. The Jews of Cochin:  Brahmin Passover, Maharajah Simhat Torah, and Caste Behavior Professor Nathan Katz The Cochin Jews provide a particularly fine example of how a small religio-ethnic community can acculturate itself within a tolerant, larger society for at least a thousand years. By narrating an appropriate historical legend with motifs from both the origin and host religious cultures; by a periodic ritual enactment of the symbols representing the poles of power in the caste hierarchy of Kerala, and by even adapting the host culture’s caste structure within its own community, a secure place was achieved within India. The Cochin Jews developed Passover customs influenced by Brahmin asceticism and Sim h at Torah royalty symbols influenced by the local nobility that fitted nicely into the framework of halakhah (Jewish law). In the sixteenth century, a question regarding the discrimination practiced by a group of Jews of attestable Jewish origin against an indigenous group of observant Jews considered to be partially descended from slaves was brought in a responsum to the great adjudicator Rabbi David ben Solomon ibn Abi Zimra (the Radbaz) of Cairo and later to his student Rabbi Jacob Castro. Their replies are models of detailed halakhic analysis steeped in compassion. In the end, though, equal status was achieved by the struggle led by A.B. Salem, a few decades before most of this small community emigrated to Israel after 1948. Medical and/or Dental Emergencies on the Sabbath Professor Fred Rosner MD, FACP It is axiomatic in Judaism that all but three biblical and rabbinic commandments are waived for pikuah nefesh (preserving and saving a human life). How do Jewish physicians, dentists, and other health professionals apply this principle when confronted with a medical or dental emergency or potential emergency on the Sabbath? What constitutes a medical emergency? How should serious but not life-threatening conditions be treated on Shabbat? Did Maimonides Practice Evidence-Based Medicine? Professor Kenneth Collins, MD Evidence-based medicine is the contemporary expression for the integration of the best research evidence with clinical expertise and patient values, enabling the physician and the patient to form a diagnostic and therapeutic alliance optimizing clinical outcomes and the quality of life. The distinguished medieval Jewish sage, physician, and philosopher, Moses Maimonides ( 1138–1204, also known as Rabbi Moshe ben Maimon or Rambam ) , who practiced in the Sultan’s palace and in Fostat, Old Cairo, Egypt, in the twelfth century, after his early years in Spain and Morocco, left an extensive legacy of medical writings which indicate his understanding of patient values and the importance of the therapeutic alliance. Health Legislation in Israel—Halakhic Perspectives Rabbi Professor Avraham Steinberg, MD During the past fifty years, medical ethics has been challenged by hitherto unimaginable questions brought about by unprecedented advances in science. Dramatic developments in the practice of medicine, such as organ transplantation and ivf and pgd procedures, have taken place. Secular medical ethics today tries to solve the myriad of new questions by applying four absolute principles. In contrast, Jewish medical ethics is based on the more flexible case-by-case (casuistry approach) halakhah (Jewish law) . In the first four to five decades of the State of Israel, medical ethics laws were enacted by the Knesset through a process of political fighting between the religious and non-religious parties. The Autopsy Law and Abortion Law are examples of this unsuccessful way of legislating medical ethics issues. For over a decade now, a new, more successful approach has been used by convening a public committee of experts to discuss the issues and draft a proposal that the Knesset then debates and votes on. The author discusses four such laws that he helped to formulate: the Patient’s Rights Act of 1996, the Genetic Intervention Act of 1999 (stem cell research law), the Dying Patient Act of 2005, and the Brain Death Respiratory Law of 2008. These laws are unique to Israel because they are based on careful halakhic analysis. Triumph of the Spirit:  A Case of a Jewish Patient in Hungary 1838 Professor Shimon Glick, MD Robert Finaly, MD Robert Finaly , md comes from a large family in Hungary, dating back many generations. After World War II, the daughter of a surviving aunt returned to Hungary to explore family roots. The search turned up a small diary, published in 1873, by an ancestor physician, Dr. Sigismund Finaly (1808-1876). The following excerpt from that diary brings to life contemporary issues in medical education and medical ethics such as patient autonomy, cultural sensitivity, and mind-body interaction. Dr. Finaly’s colleague, Professor Shimon Glick, MD brought about the publication of this account of the extraordinary recovery of a “simple” rural Jew whose faith in God defied medical logic when he refused to have his tefillin arm amputated.

His father, Fritz Finaly, had studied medicine in Vienna and managed to work as a physician in France. After their parents were deported to their deaths in Auschwitz, Robert and his brother were given over to the care of Antoinette Brun and Catholic boarding institutions in Grenoble. At the end of the war, in 1945 the three surviving aunts started searching for the boys and trying to gain custody of them. The reaction of Mademoiselle Brun and the Church was to baptize the boys in 1948. The family’s attempt to release the Finaly brothers led to five years of lawsuits. While the Church moved the young children from one hiding place to another in France, Spain, and Italy, the case gained great attention in France and throughout the world. Moshe Keller (a chemical engineer living in Grenoble), Chief Rabbi Yaakov Kaplan of France, Chief Rabbi Isaac Herzog of Israel, and many Jewish organizations were involved in the family’s struggle, which reached the Supreme Court of France. In 1953 the court ordered that the brothers be released and raised by their aunt Yehudit Rosner and her family in Gedera, Israel. Robert Finaly studied medicine in Switzerland and at the Hebrew University Hadassah School of Medicine and worked as a children’s surgeon at the Soroka Hospital in Beersheba. He became the vice-chairman of the department of children’s surgery there and taught at the Faculty of Health Sciences of Ben-Gurion University until his retirement. finaly@bezeqint.net"

Stem Cell Research Rabbi Professor Avraham Steinberg, MD There is much debate today about the ethical repercussions of research on cells taken from the earliest stages of human development. I shall review the science behind the issues and explain why halakhah (Jewish law) clearly permits stem cell research for medical purposes. On the Embryological Foresight of the Talmud Leah Poltorak, MS A well-known passage in the Talmud states that parents can pray for the gender of their unborn child only during the first forty days of pregnancy. Another passage states that the female identity of an embryo takes eighty days to be formed. At first blush, this appears to be contradictory to the basic facts of reproductive biology. Isn’t the gender of the embryo determined at the moment of conception? A more careful analysis reveals that the chromosomal makeup of the fertilized egg: XX or XY is not the only factor determining the embryo’s gender. The successful expression of the SRY gene located on the short arm of the Y chromosome is another crucial factor. In fact, it takes approximately forty days from the time of conception for male gender to become irreversibly determined and about eighty days for female gender to be determined. One can only wonder at the prophetic insight of the Talmud Sages, who pinpointed the precise timeframe for the formation of gender—long before the science of genetics was developed. Is Gender Determined by External Organs or by Genes? Rabbi Gideon Weitzman In most cases, male or female gender is a culmination of both genetics and external features. However, in rare cases, children are born with external reproductive organs different from their genetic type. For halakhah (Jewish law) these unfortunate individuals raise questions that go to the core of sex determination. For instance, does halakhah sanction surgery to give the child a clearer sexual identity? Halakhah is based on the decisions of the Talmud Sages. Lacking the technology to check genetic identity, our Sages determined gender on the basis of external organs only. I shall discuss the medical background of a few cases that are different from the classic androgynous case discussed in talmudic literature. I shall raise a number of halakhic questions and suggest that the gender of each rare case of ambiguous identity be determined by halakhic authorities by examining the individual genetic and physiological features of the particular child as early as possible. The Holy Act: Emulating God in Marriage and Birth Moshe Kuhr, MD, MPH, FAAP Deuteronomy 28:9 commands us to walk in G-d’s ways, or in other words to emulate God. The closest emulation to G-d that a human can reach is when a woman gives birth, helping the Creator create new life. The first created human emulated G-d by being both male and female (until s/he was split into Adam and Eve). The Zohar says that every new soul is created both male and female until it is split before descending into our world. When the two parts find each other, they unite in a holy union that reconstitutes the image of G-d. How can the marriage union result in such a lofty spiritual attainment? The matter is discussed at length by Raavad’s treatise on the laws of family purity, Baaley Ha’Nefesh, in the section entitled “The Holy Gate,” and by the author of “The Holy Letter.” These two works agree that the mechanism for reaching holiness is the intent during the act. Raavad takes a halakhic attitude, while “The Holy Letter” takes a spiritually transcending attitude. Both of them differ from Maimonides’ Aristotelian attitude. Jewish Medical Ethics for the Student and Practitioner Professor Fred Rosner, MD, MACP Jewish Medical Ethics is a vast subject of many topics and issues. The classic Jewish sources—the Torah, Talmud, Codes of Jewish laws, and the responsa literature of the last four hundred years—are full of material relating to the ethical dilemmas that medical students and physicians face today and provide the basis for case-by-case rabbinic adjudication. In particular, new technological developments in medicine pose new problems for rabbinic adjudicators to answer for the Torah observant student and practitioner. Is It Time for Jewish Medicine? Gilles-Avraham Morali, MD The concepts of disease and healing appear in the Torah in relation to spiritual imperfection and prayer respectively. Indeed, recent biopsychosocial studies have demonstrated that religious involvement and spirituality have beneficial effects on health, such as prolonged life, with less cardiovascular disease, hypertension, and depression. I propose a model in which prevention of several disorders may be attained by appropriate speech, through hypnotherapy and prayer. Several studies have shown the positive effect of remote, intercessory prayer on acute and chronic disorders, such as prevention of complications after acute myocardial infarction or sepsis. Hypnosis has proven to be effective in pain reduction or psychosomatic disorders such as irritable bowel syndrome. Based on the sayings of the Jewish Sages, I have constructed a model in which primary and secondary prevention of many diseases is possible through implementation of positive thinking and elimination of negative habits. Why the Biopsychosocial Model of Chronic Illness Works Amiel Levin, MD The science of medicine during the twentieth century focused on research, diagnoses and treatment of the biological etiology of illness. Only recently has medicine begun to understand the psychological, social and spiritual dimensions of illness. Dr. George Engle’s Biopsychosocial Model (BPS) was a pioneer effort in recognizing that mental state and spiritual well being affect the biological body. This article gives the example of the relations of heart disease and psychological stress, social status, and spiritual feelings. To understand why this effect works, we turn to the letters and talks of the Lubavitcher Rebbe, Rabbi Menahem Mendel Schneerson, who maintained that a healthy soul is essential for the healing process of the body. The roles, responsibilities and duties of both patient and physician are explained. Rav’s Beautiful Ratio: An Excursion into Aesthetics Rabbi Mois Navon The Talmud Sage Rav teaches that when tying tsitsit (ritual tassels) there is both an upper limit and a lower limit for the amount of braiding, as well as an ideal—“beautiful”—amount given in the form of a ratio of braided to unbraided sections. Embedded within these dry details lies the key to understanding the profound nature of aesthetics within Jewish thought. To what extent does Jewish law demand this ratio to be met and why? If the sole reason is simply “beauty,” of what concern is aesthetics to halakhic imperative? By answering these questions, an appreciation of the depth of Rav’s teaching can be obtained—an appreciation that touches upon the very essence of the human quest to encounter the Divine. This excursion into aesthetics delves into the number phi, known as the Divine Proportion, as well as the positions of Immanuel Kant, Rabbi Joseph B. Soloveitchik. Complex Adaptive Systems in the Light of the Torah Rabbi Professor Yossef Zukin In both science and business systems there is a trend towards increasing complexity, the need for flexibility, and compliance with multiple demands. On the other hand, however, the user wants increasingly simpler interfaces. A complex adaptive system using fuzzy logic can face this challenge because it provides a formal basis for the manipulation and computation of complexity, imprecision, and vagueness. At the same time, it is presented in language that can be understood by non-specialist users. An automobile can be a complex machine for a mechanical engineer, while being a simple device for the user who drives it. Torah can be considered the main reference point for a complex system being contracted and conveyed through a simple channel. Torah is the most complex system we have because it encompasses the entire universe. Nevertheless, there are simple ways to learn it. Torah also presents clear and simple objectives, even though its inherent complexity remains. Jewish law is based on six hundred and thirteen commandments summarized in the Torah, usually in just a few simple words, that are later discussed at length in the Talmud and halakhic literature. The considerations presented here are based on the international theoretical literature, a cognitive model using fuzzy logic, and my professional work and Torah knowledge. The conclusion is reached that science and corporate businesses are evolving toward the Torah method of handling complexity and simplicity. Corporate Stumbling Blocks and Blind Consumers Rabbi Carmi Wisemon, MSW After the Industrial Revolution, governments and corporate businesses started encouraging the public to consume more. The Torah commandment not to place stumbling blocks before the morally blind is being violated when the objects of consumption harm the consumers and when the production, use, and disposal of the manufactured products destroy the environment. As Torah-observant Jews we should reverse this dangerous trend and reduce our levels of consumption. Truth Consciousness:  Inner Landscapes of Authenticity in Chinese and Jewish Tradition Professor Vera Schwarcz Both Jewish and Chinese traditions center on a truth-consciousness that presupposes an individual mind capable of examining and overcoming its own prejudice. In both cultures, there is great emphasis on the practical consequence of truth-consciousness, on how one redefines moral action and the authentic personality. In the Torah world view as well as in Confucianism, truth is something that is hard won, difficult to name and to attain. Key differences between the concept of Jewish emet and of Chinese zhen will be explored. The Jewish view of “truth” for example, affects the totality of human consciousness, moving from alef through tav. It demands that a person consider truly all angles and then risk a further connection to God’s own perspective, where the “lip of truth” finds its ultimate guarantee. In the non-theological world view of Confucianism, which centers on concepts of nature and an organicist view of the dao, there is nonetheless a strong emphasis upon the moral prerequisites for genuine knowledge. The seeker for zhen has to examine the inner landscape of the mind along with the reality of the world beyond. Only where there is a harmonious, hard-won accord between these two realms does genuine truth prevail. In both Jewish and Chinese culture there are extensive debates about the locus of truth consciousness: Is it innate? Acquired? Both? By looking at Jewish and Chinese views of embodied veracity, the aim is to illuminate both emet and zhen and show how they provide a much needed corrective to the corrosive relativism of our times. Franz Kafka’s Foreboding of the Holocaust and His Late Thirst for Judaism Professor Dan Vogel Whether Franz Kafka, who died in 1924, prophesied, predicted, or intuited the coming of the Holocaust has been discussed and disputed. I uphold that he did. As testimony to his foreboding of a coming catastrophe for European Jewry, this article will offer his insights into their bleak future as expressed in his non-fiction—diaries, letters, and remarks by contemporaries. This later metamorphosed into fiction as characters, scenes, and symbols of astonishing prescience of aspects of that monumental crime. We can see this in his literary use of misguided technology, dehumanization of victims, Führer-veneration, and sanctified injustice. “Metamorphosis,” “In the Penal Colony,” and The Trial, written in the period 1912-1915, are major works in which Kafka portrayed his foreboding, although there is nothing ostensibly Jewish in these stories. A deepening consciousness of his Jewish heritage was a concomitant manifestation of Kafka’s sensitivity to the “Jewish problem.” Kafka’s passionate study of Hebrew and Torah at the end of his short life gives a more positive prognosis for the future of the Jewish people.

The first inspired him to remain Torah observant; the second to become an instructor of college English. He was appointed instructor of English at Yeshiva College, and taught there for 24 years. He earned a PhD from New York University in 1956. At Yeshiva University he became a full professor of English and also served as dean of Stern College from 1957-1967. He has published three books, The Three Masks of American Tragedy, Emma Lazarus, and Mark Twain’s Jews, as well as numerous articles on American literature, the theory of literature, and American-Jewish literature in professional journals. After making aliyah in 1973, he was appointed professor of English and chairman of the department at the Michlalah-Jerusalem College for Women. Partial retirement came in 1988 and final retirement in 1995. He volunteers at the Yad Sarah organization and as associate editor of the Jewish Bible Quarterly. His current research and writing has a definite Jewish dimension to it.

Individuation and the Benoni Rabbi Arthur Seltzer, PhD In analytical psychology, the shadow is understood to be that part of ourselves containing material suppressed and hidden from consciousness. This unconscious material is difficult for the conscious mind to access or comprehend, yet its influence is profound. C.G. Jung writes that to attempt to ignore or suppress shadow material is to perpetuate its neurotic hold over us. Only through recognizing and incorporating the shadow as an integral part of the conscious self do we become truly whole and transformed. The above may be compared with hasidic psychology which speaks of each person possessing an animal soul and a divine soul. It is only through the supremacy of the divine soul over the animal soul, accompanied by the subsequent transformation of the animal soul itself by the divine soul to Godliness, that an integrated and transformed personality can rise in its spirituality. This transformation, elevation, and incorporation of the unconscious/animal soul to consciousness/Godliness is the essence of the spiritual quest. ‘Therapist-Friendly’ and ‘Therapist-Unfriendly’  Rabbinic Responsa Seymour Hoffman, PhD In this paper several examples of ‘therapist-friendly’ and ‘therapist-unfriendly’ responses and views of prominent contemporary rabbis to questions dealing with halakhic-psychotherapy issues are presented. Therapist-friendly responsa are defined as rabbinic rulings that do not encumber the Torah-observant psychotherapist in practicing his profession; in some cases, the therapist-friendly responsa even facilitate the Torah-observant psychotherapist. I shall first present several examples of therapist-unfriendly halakhic rulings and comment on them. Then I shall present examples of therapist-friendly responsa, followed by my comments and those of another Torah-observant therapist. The Psychology of Being Commanded Rabbi Mois Navon The Talmud relates that Rabbi Hanina said that one who is commanded to perform mitsvot (commandments) receives a greater reward for doing a mitsvah than one who is not commanded to keep the Torah receives for doing the same good deed, even if it is out of the goodness of his heart. Tosafot and the Ritva interpret Rabbi Hanina’s principle to mean that human nature resists obeying external demands. Therefore the person who exerts greater effort to overcome his or her evil inclination deserves greater merit. Moreover, although it might sound paradoxical, choosing to obey the command of G-d is the only arena in which we truly can express free will. Torah, Spirituality, and Psychotherapy Aaron Rabinowitz, PhD Advocates of a rapprochement between religion and psychiatry-psychology promote a dialogue between the two. Recently, numerous books and scholarly papers have appeared which reflect a more sympathetic attitude towards religion and spirituality, replacing the antagonistic attitude which had previously prevailed. This is so both on a theoretical level and in the practice of psychotherapy. This paper addresses the use of Torah spirituality as an integral part of the process of psychotherapy. Judaic spiritual psychotherapy, as I practice it, makes use of three principles: 1. the concept of the unconscious as promulgated by Rabbi Yisroel Salanter (Lipkin); 2. the importance of interpersonal relationships rooted in the Torah ideal of a covenantal community; 3. enhancement of one’s self-image stemming from the realization that humans are created in the Divine image. Therapy can help the client cement his/her relationship with the Almighty formed at Sinai, leading to greater psychological health. This is accomplished by integrating Torah concepts as articulated by our sages and later talmudic luminaries, including the teachings of the hasidic masters and musar teachers. Case studies are presented which illustrate this form of psychotherapy. Sigmund Freud: An Alternate View Nathaniel S. Lehrman, MD Two fundamental errors underlie Freud’s psychoanalytic work: His denial of the fundamental Jewish view that the conflicts between the needs of society and an individual’s sexual drives can be resolved by a satisfying marriage; His belief that an investigation of supposed childhood roots is necessary in order to correct the psychiatric symptoms that a patient has today. In this paper I shall argue these two points in an anecdotal manner, based on my over-fifty years of experience working in psychiatry and psychoanalysis. Birkhat Ha’Gomel:  Community Response to Acute Stress Disorder Judith S. Bendheim Guedalia, PhD The aim of this paper is to propose the introduction of a communal ritual as a posttrauma early intervention technique. There are specific community-oriented methods for dealing with trauma survivors; we believe that, in particular, the Jewish ritual of Birkhat Ha’Gomel (the blessing recited when saved from danger) is helpful for reducing chronic effects of trauma. Similar posttrauma traditions are seen in other ethnic groups, such as the Navajo; those will be briefly discussed as well. It is important to note that therapies that are currently employed as the result of years of research have many similarities to those rituals that have existed for thousands of years. When providing early intervention for a trauma survivor, it is important to be aware of culturally appropriate treatments as well as the most commonly used professional methods. A combination of these techniques may be effective to alleviate acute stress disorder and prevent chronic posttraumatic stress in the general public. Personality Change through Contemplative Meditation:  An Integrative Hasidic and Psychological Approach Yaacov Lefcoe, MA (Psych) This paper outlines an approach to integrating the Habad Hasidic practice and philosophy of meditation with some contemporary psychological thought on ‘object relations’ and personality development within the God relationship. A bridging concept, the shiura or internal ‘God representation,’ assists in drawing a comparison of complementary models of personality changes that can occur in a person’s relationship with God, particularly as cultivated through Jewish contemplative meditation (hitbonenut). We focus on the insights of contemporary psychological theorist Moshe Halevi Spero. Some implications and ways of using this complementarity are explored. The Maimonides Hospital Experiments and Psychic Dreams Professor Samuel W. Spero Is the potential to receive extrasensory communication in dreams a natural phenomenon? What is the Jewish view? Is it measurable and amenable to experimentation? A series of experiments relating to this last question were conducted in the Sleep Laboratory of Maimonides Hospital in Brooklyn. These experiments verified to a high degree of scientific validity that extrasensory communication is indeed possible. After describing these experiments and their results, I shall give the explanation of psychic dreams offered by Rabbi Moshe Hayyim Luzatto (the Ramhal). Is the potential to receive extrasensory communication in dreams a natural phenomenon? What is the Jewish view? Is it measurable and amenable to experimentation? The Circumcision Controversy:  Examining Metsitsah Be’Peh by Halakhah and Microscope Rabbi Aaron Eli Glatt, MD Brit milah (ritual circumcision) is a fundamental commandment of Judaism. First performed by our forefather Abraham nearly four thousand years ago, most of the laws and rituals regarding this precept are based upon the Oral Law and tradition. Three recent scientific articles and case reports postulate that there may be an increased risk of certain infectious diseases (particularly herpes simplex genital infection) in Jewish babies who undergo metsitsah be’peh (oral suction) as part of brit milah. This paper will provide an historical and halakhic overview to metsitsah be’peh and discuss the different halakhic opinions regarding how it should be done. I shall review the infectious diseases potentially involved and the risk and evidence for mohel (circumciser) transmission of contagion during metsitsah be’peh, and conclude with practical rulings from great sages and adjudicators. In the final analysis, each family must consult its own rabbi for advice. The author has reviewed the transcript of this paper, but much detail has been sacrificed for the cause of brevity. The Terri Schiavo Case—from the Viewpoint of Jewish Law Rabbi Barry M. Kinzbrunner, MD The Terri Schiavo case sparked tremendous controversy in the United States and abroad regarding how to best care for patients near the end of life. For Jewish patients in similar situations, halakhah (Jewish law) provides the guidance necessary to make appropriate decisions. The issues raised by Terri Schiavo’s case will be explored in this context: 1. Whether and under what circumstances medical interventions may be refused by, withheld from, or withdrawn from terminally ill Jewish patients—including artificial nutritional support; 2. The conditions under which Jewish patients may execute advance directives consistent with halakhah; 3. The halakhic definitions of terminal illness vis à vis the medical definition of a persistent vegetative state (PVS). It is concluded that: Withholding life-prolonging interventions in terminally ill patients is permitted under certain circumstances, while withdrawing is generally not. Artificial nutritional support is considered basic care by most rabbis and must be provided to the terminally ill patient in a way that is beneficial and not harmful. Advance directives are permissible as long as they are compatible with Jewish law. PVS is not a terminal condition under Jewish law. Therefore, according to halakhah, Terri Schiavo was not terminally ill. Halakhah would not have allowed her feeding tube to have been removed because withdrawal of treatment is generally forbidden and a feeding tube would not be considered an impediment to death. The removal of the feeding tube would be considered a direct cause of her death. The Evolving Feminine: An Enlightened View from Kabbalah Sarah Yehudit Schneider Based on a midrashic tale about the sun and the moon (Talmud Hulin 60b), Jewish mystical writings identify seven stages of waning and waxing that mark the feminine life cycle. They apply on all scales from the span of an individual woman’s life to the history of creation (for the entire period of existence from the beginning of time to its end is but a single circuit of the moon). In the seventh and final stage, woman stands equal and opposite to man and they meet for the first time as spiritual, intellectual, and emotional mates. This perfect marriage has been our (perhaps unconscious) yearning for six thousand years, and from its consummation flow all the promised blessings of the world to come. This article is taken from the author’s book, Kabbalistic Writings on the Nature of Masculine and Feminine , which builds its thesis upon the following texts: Rabbi Isaac Luria’s Diminishment of the Moon , Rabbi Yehuda Ashlag’s commentary on the Zohar, Rabbi Shlomo Elyashiv’s Diminishment of the Moon , Rabbi Abraham Isaac Kook’s Orot Ha’Kodesh , Rabbi Kalonymous Kalman Ha’Levi Epstein’s Meor V’Shemesh , and Rabbi Shneur Zalman of Liadi’s commentary on the prayer book. The Age of the Universe:  Using the Many-Worlds Interpretation Alexander Poltorak, PhD There is an apparent discrepancy between the cosmological age of the universe, estimated at twelve to fourteen billion years, and the ‘biblical’ age, believed in the Jewish tradition to be less than six thousand years. This paper is a sequel to “On the Age of the Universe,” presented at the Third Miami International Conference on Torah and Science (1999) and published in B’Or Ha’Torah 13 (2002), which aimed to resolve the contradiction from the point of view of the collapse of the wave function in the Copenhagen interpretation of Quantum Mechanics.1 I shall now approach the problem from the slightly different point of view of the Many-Worlds Interpretation of Quantum Mechanics. On Contradictions between Torah and Science:  The Creation of the Universe Professor Nathan Aviezer Most people believe that the first chapter of Genesis—the Torah account of Creation—has great moral value, but that these verses cannot be taken literally. We shall show that, in complete contrast to this widespread misconception, current scientific evidence is in remarkable agreement with the literal words of the Torah account of the origin and development of the universe. Recent discoveries show that the first chapter of Genesis records the events that actually occurred in the past. To establish our thesis, we shall draw on the latest scientific findings from diverse fields. It will be seen that faith in G-d and accepting the truth of the Torah do not require the abandonment of rational thinking. On the contrary, scientific findings supporting the Big Bang Theory have become important tools for understanding many biblical passages and for deepening one’s faith. Modern science imparts new insights and deeper meaning into the eternal words of the Torah. A Correspondence with  Rabbi Menahem Mendel Schneerson Professor Cyril Domb, FRS In 1961, the London Chronicle invited physicist Cyril Domb to write on whether the Big Bang or Steady State theory was \"better\" for Torah-observant Jews. To Professor Domb’s surprise, after the article was published he received a lengthy letter of comment from the Lubavitcher Rebbe, Rabbi Menahem Mendel Schneerson. The Rebbe both gave pointed criticism and encouraged Professor Domb to become more engaged in educating Jews to resolve apparent contradictions between Torah and science. This led to a correspondence which has never before been published. In Professor Domb's reply to the Rebbe and in the Rebbe's additional two letters, a number of fundamental issues are clarified. The Rebbe’s letters reveal a leader immersed in Talmud, Hasidism, and physics and in the dynamics of activating his fellow Jews. Long before in 1950 he became the seventh Lubavitcher Rebbe (the spiritual leader of the Habad Lubavitch hasidic movement), as a young man Rabbi Menahem Mendel Schneerson studied natural sciences and philosophy in Berlin and Paris and received a degree in engineering from the  Polytechnic Institute of Paris. These studies were in addition and secondary to his life-long immersion in Torah study and Jewish activism. After his father-in-law, Rabbi Yosef Yitshak Schneerson, the sixth Lubavitcher Rebbe, moved the center of Habad Hasidism from the Soviet Union to the United States, he joined him and started work as a naval architect at the Brooklyn Navy Yard in highly classified projects that helped defeat Nazi Germany. Part of the Rebbe’s dynamic world-wide struggle against assimilation was to convince modern Jews that science does not negate the truth of the Torah. The correspondence that he initiated with Professor Cyril Domb is just one example of how the Rebbe reached out to millions of fellow Jews, giving guidance and encouragement to live according to the Torah and teach others to do so also.

B'OR HA'TORAH 17 B'OR HA'TORAH 17 $10 via PayPal - International Shipping $5 via PayPal - PDF only To reconcile evolution with Creation, UCLA professor of biology Eliezer Zeiger discards the propagandistic elements of neo-Darwinian theory and uses the more durable model of the Kabbalah, reaching a new definition of “species.” The coauthor of a major university textbook on plant physiology, Zeiger is using the ideas in this paper as the conceptual base for a biology textbook aimed for use by Jewish high schools. B’OR HA’TORAH JOURNAL OF SCIENCE, LIFE AND ART IN THE LIGHT OF THE TORAH A peer-reviewed journal on the interrelationship of Judaism, science and technology, psychology, the arts, and social issues, B’Or Ha’Torah illuminates a range of topics from the cosmology and ecology of Genesis; the creation ex nihilo vs. evolution and faith vs. reason debates; the views of halakhah (Jewish law) on stem cell research and genetic engineering; and the soul-mind-brain-memory-body connection. Rabbis and religious Jews with no science background as well as professionals in all fields with no Torah background can enjoy this inspiring publication in hardcopy and digital formats. To receive a free PDF file of an individual article, send the author, title, and volume number to: bht@jct.ac.il This offer is limited to three articles. Teaching Evolution in Jewish Schools Lee M. Spetner, PhD Evolution should definitely be taught in the life-science courses in Jewish high schools. It should be taught critically rather than as indoctrination. The mechanism of mutations and natural selection should be explained together with the evidence for them. These concepts should be made sufficiently clear to enable students to understand why people accept the theory of evolution. The distinction between different uses of the term “evolution” should be explained, noting for what kind of “evolution” there is evidence and for what kind there is not. Evolutionism, which is a philosophy espousing that life originated and evolved through purely natural events can be described and explained, noting that it is held by many secularists but Jewish tradition rejects it, and pointing out that it is not science. Explaining the scientific fallacies on which evolutionism is built is appropriate for a science class. Its philosophical fallacies, on the other hand might be beyond the scope of a high-school science course. Several of the most important and most popular of the scientific fallacies of evolutionism will be described and explained in this paper. A Unified View of Torah and Evolution Professor Eliezer Zeiger The unifying power of Kabbalah is optimally suited for a unification of Torah and science. We learn from the Torah that the concept of evolution, understood as the unfolding of Creation, permeates the divine plan underlying the destiny of the universe. God created Adam Kadmon; the four Worlds of Emanation, Creation, Formation, and Action; and the ten sfirot. God populated the universe with inanimate matter, plants, animals, and human beings. God created all living creatures via channels of energy called minim in Hebrew and named “species” by science. The divine origin of species is the reason why scientists have not been able to find evidence of new species postulated by the scientific theory of evolution. On the other hand, the unfolding of the universe, described by science as an interplay between mutations and natural selection, is an integral part of the divine plan. In the Torah, natural selection is described as Divine Providence; and mutations, as free choice. After rectifying their koah ha’medameh (the power of imagination), scientists and religious scholars have a golden opportunity to unify their consciousness in a rectified theory of evolution and the universe. This paper is based on the teachings of Rabbi Yitzchak Ginsburgh (www.inner.org). Monkeying around with Hominid Evolution Yaacov Hanoka, PhD Paleontologists who deal with human origins operate with the tacit assumption that evolution is an established fact. This leads to the belief that humans are descended from less advanced creatures, the so-called “hominids.” This view is totally at variance with what the Torah says regarding our origin. What, in fact, is the evidence of hominid evolution? There are, basically, two forms of “evidence.” One is the assignment and identification of a particular fossil—a task that has been suffused with controversy throughout the past century. The second is the dating of these fossils. We shall discuss the heated controversies regarding fossil identification and ask whether much of this constitutes real science. We shall also explore the problem contained within the fossil dates as they relate to geologic factors. Dating the Earth Yaacov Hanoka, PhD Radioactive rock dating is used to derive that the Earth is some 4.5 billion years old. This is in contrast to what the Torah says—that the world is less than 6000 years old. An old Earth is needed for the theory of evolution. Attempts are made to date fossils, and such dates are then critical in establishing sequences in time and developing the scaffolding that underlies much of the theory of evolution. The study of human origins, also based on the fundamental beliefs stemming from the theory of evolution, relies heavily on the ability to date fossils. This article will discuss some of the most widely used dating methods. They can be listed in the following order of decreasing accuracy: tree-ring dating; radioactive carbon (carbon 14) dating; and radioactive rock dating. The uniformitarian assumptions behind the methods and their limitations will be discussed at length. It will be shown that there are serious questions regarding the application of all of them. A background to this discussion will focus on the revival of catastrophism in modern science. The Anthropic Principle: What Is It  and Why Is It Important for the Believing Person Professor Nathan Aviezer In recent years, it has become clear to many scientists that the universe appears to have been specifically designed for the existence and well-being of human life. This phenomenon, which has attracted considerable attention in the science community, is known as the “Anthropic Principle” (from the Greek work anthropos, meaning \"man\"). The Anthropic Principle expresses itself in two ways: (1) very slight changes in the laws of nature would have made it impossible for life to exist, and (2) human life would not have been possible if not for the occurrence in the past of a large number of highly improbably events. Whereas the secular scientist sees these occurrences as mere lucky accidents, the believing person sees in them the guiding hand of the Creator. I shall show that, in contrast to the views of the secular scientists, the believing person is indeed justified in seeing the Anthropic Principle as a confirmation of his or her belief in the Almighty. Rabbinic Silence: Intelligent Design? Rabbi Professor Moshe Dovid Tendler The disengagement of Torah scholars from secular amoral society has allowed for autonomy and “feel-good morality” to become the yardstick by which societal morality is evaluated. The absence of intense dialogue between rabbinic decisors and the leaders of the professions and the business world has left our co-religionists uninstructed on issues that impact Torah values. The rabbinic community has failed to influence those who set ethical and moral standards for our secular society. During the battle in the United States court systems over whether biological evolution should be taught with or without a concurrent discussion of Intelligent Design, the Torah community was not heard. The counter attack that must be launched is clearly enunciated in our Torah, but no one is listening because we are silent. DNA Markers that Illuminate Israelite/Jewish Migration Professor Miryam Z. Wahrman The use of genetic technology, in particular, the analysis and comparison of specific DNA sequences, can shed light on family relationships and kinship. This type of research has also been successfully applied to studies on the migration and dispersal of larger groups, i.e., populations with common origins and ancestry. Members of Jewish communities dispersed throughout the world who share common origins and ancestry also carry common genetic markers. The markers that are associated with Israelite/Jewish populations, specific DNA sequences called haplotypes, have been identified and studied in Jewish and non-Jewish populations around the world. The study of those markers has made it possible to analyze and confirm patterns of migration and assimilation, some of which have been documented by historical evidence and others that were previously unknown. This paper presents and analyzes data on Israelite/Jewish genetic haplotypes with regard to Israelite/Jewish migration, and in some cases assimilation, in Asia, Africa, Europe, North and South America. Just as archeological methods confirm our biblical historical record, so can genetic studies illuminate the process of migration of the Israelite/Jewish people, the wandering Jews, over the millennia. Creatio Ex Nihilo, Number Theory, Quantum Vacuum,  and the Big Bang Alexander Poltorak, PhD This informal paper is a continuation of a discussion I had with Dr. Tsvi (Victor) Saks, of blessed memory, about using Peano’s axiomatic approach in arithmetic as an analogy to illustrate the principle of yesh me’ayin , or the creation of something from nothing (creatio ex nihilo). Can we find at least a rough example or a coarse illustration of creatio ex nihilo in the worlds of mathematics and physics? The function of an empty set in set theory, the behavior of a quantum vacuum, and Big Bang Theory are explored as illustrations to—not parallels of—God’s creation of something (everything, actually) from literally absolutely nothing. In the examples given below, the starting point is of course never the absolute nothing that preceded the six days of Creation. Can Machines Think? Tsvi Victor Saks, PhD In its early stages, the field of Artificial Intelligence (AI) had as its main goal the invention of computer programs having the general problem-solving abilities of humans. Since 1965, leading researchers have been predicting that, within twenty years, machines will be capable of doing any work a man can do, but that goal is as elusive as ever. Actually, whether or not this goal will ever be achieved is a subject of great disagreement among leading experts in the field. AI has gone in directions quite different from the expectations of the original founders, who wanted to create programs that could prove mathematical theorems and play chess at an expert level. Those goals have been achieved, but it has proven to be vastly more difficult to create programs that exhibit common-sense, and have enough real-world knowledge to perform tasks such as reading the daily newspaper. Along the way, there has been a major shift of emphasis from general-purpose programs toward performance programs or Expert Systems, with highly specialized competence and limited to particular areas of expertise. I shall share two personal experiences, and then attempt to draw some general conclusions: 1) Learning a hasidic discourse gave me insight to design a program that automatically scheduled a Boeing helicopter factory. 2) By inserting a piece of knowledge into an automated scheduling program, the program used the knowledge more effectively that I would have. Do Scripture and Mathematics Disagree on the Number Pi? Professor Isaac Elishakoff Elliot Pines, Ph.D. The five parts of this paper discuss the seeming contradiction between scripture and mathematics concerning the value of π (pi), and offer possible resolutions. Alongside a review of the widely accepted opinions and some recent investigations, we humbly offer our own suggestions. In Part One, we introduce the apparent conflict and its significance. In Part Two, Professor Elishakoff takes a direct approach, investigating some pertinent issues of Jewish law and offering an analysis in terms of engineering practice. In Part Three, Professor Elishakoff and Dr. Pines discuss evidence that the Sages of the Talmudic era had knowledge of π to a greater accuracy than that implied by the surface reading of the Scripture that defines the Jewish legal standard. A hint of knowledge of π of still greater accuracy is found in the Bible itself. In Part Four, Dr. Pines continues this train of thought into the esoteric, commencing with a supporting information-theory based analysis. Pines follows up his discussion with an exploration of possible kabbalistic meaning. An appendix with an interesting physics-based speculation further develops Part Four. Finally, in Part Five, the authors conclude that the contradiction implicit in a superficial understanding may be masking an underlying harmony on several levels that makes itself known only through careful examination, which scientific and popular texts should be providing. The Music of the Celestial Spheres David Medved, PhD The first five verses of Psalm 19 depict “the music of the spheres”—the praise given by the heavens to the magnificence of God’s created universe. I attempt to answer here the apparent contradiction in line 4 of this psalm that “their sound is unheard.” Our sages and commentators vary in their interpretation of these five verses. Rashi believed that the heavens do not speak but stimulate us to gaze in awe at the wonders of God’s creation. Maimonides, on the other hand, maintains that “the psalmist really means to describe…what the spheres actually do and not what man actually thinks of them.” Ibn Ezra says that one must be well versed in astronomy to understand the celestial magnificence of Psalm 19. Five hundred years after King David, the Pythagoreans postulated that the planets emit musical sounds but at frequencies outside the range of human hearing. These concepts were given various forms of expression in Western culture through the following twenty-five centuries, culminating with modern science. Discoveries such as pulsars, gravitational waves, acoustic oscillations in the early universe, and solar ultrasound seem to confirm the secrets embedded in Scripture. If the calculated frequencies of gravitational waves were sound waves, they would be in the range of human audibility. CLICking on Redemption:  Reflections on Jews and Judaism in Cyberspace Oren Baruch Stier, PhD. Does the Internet fill specifically Jewish needs? How real is virtual reality? Cyberspace defines a curious place in modern consciousness: neither here nor there, it is everywhere and nowhere at the same time. Judaism, in contrast, is almost always localized, generally requiring physical presence for its practices. Yet Jews, ever on the cutting edge of technology, have taken to the wonders of the web with relish. Perhaps this comes from a familiarity arising from the long history of Jewish Diaspora existence and homelessness. In the age of Jewish national homecoming, has the Internet provided a virtual, parallel version? I shall address these issues from both theoretical and research-based perspectives, the latter focusing on the particular case of Chabad Lubavitch in Cyberspace (CLIC). Matest Agrest: 1915-2005 Mikhail M. Agrest, PhD Although he was only five feet tall, I will always remember my father Matest Agrest as a giant.

B'OR HA'TORAH 16 B'OR HA'TORAH 16 $10 via PayPal - International Shipping $5 via PayPal - PDF only How can the complex dilemma of genetically predetermined behavior versus the Torah axiom of human free will be bridged? ∞ A geneticist describes how his discovery of the role of methylation in the formation of DNA supports the claim of the Talmud Sages that some traits are inherited from the mother only and other traits are inherited from the father only. B’OR HA’TORAH JOURNAL OF SCIENCE, LIFE AND ART IN THE LIGHT OF THE TORAH A peer-reviewed journal on the interrelationship of Judaism, science and technology, psychology, the arts, and social issues, B’Or Ha’Torah illuminates a range of topics from the cosmology and ecology of Genesis; the creation ex nihilo vs. evolution and faith vs. reason debates; the views of halakhah (Jewish law) on stem cell research and genetic engineering; and the soul-mind-brain-memory-body connection. Rabbis and religious Jews with no science background as well as professionals in all fields with no Torah background can enjoy this inspiring publication in hardcopy and digital formats. To receive a free PDF file of an individual article, send the author, title, and volume number to: bht@jct.ac.il This offer is limited to three articles. Genetic Predestination and Free Will Rabbi Professor Moshe Dovid Tendler The focus of this paper is to analyze the many research studies on the interrelationship of genes and traits of moral behavior. The claims of genetically predetermined behavior present a dramatic challenge to our fundamental theological axiom that humankind was granted free will by our Creator. Genetically predetermined behavior also challenges the secular legal system, which assigns personal responsibility for actions only if they are done voluntarily, without coercion. If genes are implicated as coercive forces in such behavioral traits as aggressiveness, drug addiction, and sexual orientation, how can any system of reward and punishment be operative? An analysis of biblical and postbiblical literature will be presented to elucidate this dilemma. Genetic Imprinting and Gene Silencing Professor Marvin Gold The genetic expression of a small number of the 30,000 or so genes in human cells is not derived from both inherited parental chromosomes, but is exclusively expressed from either the maternal or the paternal partner. This process, whereby only one version of a gene is expressed, depending on whether it was passed on to the fetus through the egg or the sperm, is called genetic imprinting. Imprinting is a reversible modification of DNA that can lead to differential expression of maternally or paternally inherited genes. Since this process adds additional information to the DNA sequence, it has been called “epigenetics” (epi=on). Our Sages described genetic imprinting a long time ago when they revealed the source of some human characteristics as coming directly from God, others from the father, and others from the mother. We now understand how this differentiation works. There are two proposed mechanisms for the differentiation, each backed by experimental evidence: the postreplicative methylation of specific DNA cytosine residues; and post-translational modification of histones. It is not yet clear if these mechanisms are universal. The hidden fingerprints of the God are thus found in the pattern of human development at the molecular level. Kosher Pork and Treife Tomatoes: Genetically Modified Plants and Animals Professor Miryam Z. Wahrman Scientists are now able to manipulate the traits of plants and animals to produce genetically modified (GM) organisms with novel features. The successful production of GM fish, pigs, and other species leads to the speculation that genetic engineering could alter previously nonkosher species, transforming them into kosher species. In addition, might plants or animals genetically altered with DNA from nonkosher animals be rendered unkosher? Does genetic engineering provide a way to produce kosher pork and treife tomatoes? Would plants genetically engineered with animal DNA lose their neutral pareve status? Is it permissible under Jewish law to alter species and produce barnyards, ponds and fields filled with GM animals and plants?  These questions will be addressed by considering rabbinic and talmudic perspectives on issues involved in genetic engineering. The principles of kilayim (forbidden mixtures); V’rappo yirappe (“Heal, he shall heal”); and tsaar baaley hayyim (concern for the suffering of animals) will be addressed. Moses Maimonides the Physician Professor Fred Rosner MD, FACP This paper will discuss the medical writings of Moses Maimonides and his practice of medicine. He stands out as one of the most illustrious physicians of all times. Maimonides died on December 13, 1204, and was buried in Tiberias. The Jewish, Christian, and Moslem worlds mourned him. His literary ability was incredible, and his knowledge encyclopedic. He mastered nearly everything known in the fields of theology, mathematics, law, philosophy, astronomy, ethics, and, of course, medicine. As a physician, he treated disease by the scientific method, not by guesswork, superstition, or rule of thumb. His attitude toward the practice of medicine came from his deep religious background, which made the preservation of life and health a Divine commandment. His inspiration lives on through the years, and his position as one of the medical giants of history is indelibly recorded. He served as the physician of sultans and princes, and, as Sir William Osler said, was the “Prince of Physicians.” The heritage of his great medical writings is increasingly appreciated. To the Jewish people, Maimonides symbolizes the highest possible human spiritual and intellectual achievement. Psychoneuroimmunology, Spirituality/Religiosity, and Health Yakir Kaufman, MD Psychoneuroimmunology (PNI), through advances in research technologies, has shown that the mind affects the body. We now know that different states of mind have an effect on our health. “Negative” states of mind, such as stress, anger, anxiety, and sadness, impair immune and endocrine system functions and thus increase risk for disease. On the other hand, numerous studies have shown that “positive” states of mind, stress reduction and higher well-being levels all reduce risk for disease. We live in an exciting period in which advances in scientific knowledge are bridging a conceptual gap between science and spirituality and religiosity. This gap was caused by decades of alienation and conflict. Science increasingly acknowledges the significance of spirituality and religion in our health and lives. Scientists now are presenting a large body of research data in this growing field. Studies show that spirituality and religiosity have beneficial effects on mental and physical health and reduce morbidity and mortality in many diseases. The World Health Organization defines health as a complete state of physical, social and psychospiritual well-being. Spirituality and religiosity enhance all three of these components of health. Liver Transplantation  from a Living Donor Rabbi Aaron Eli Glatt, MD End stage cirrhosis—liver failure—secondary to many different etiologies or illnesses is a major cause of death. Cadaveric liver donations do not suffice to meet the current transplantation needs, and hence alternative options are necessary. The adult liver can regenerate, and modern surgical techniques have progressed to the stage where the donation and transplantation of part of a living donor’s liver to another person is technologically feasible. Numerous medical, ethical, and halakhic issues are raised by this procedure. Is this surgery comparable to blood donation, or bone marrow, kidney or other tissue transplants taken from a live donor? What is the true risk to the donor? Under what, if any, circumstances is any living donor bequest permitted? Is one required to donate if this will save a life? Does it matter if the recipient is a child or an adult? A relative or a friend? Using halakhic sources, we shall explore potential answers of Jewish law to these and related questions. How Prayer and Faith Affect Health Rabbi Abraham Twerski, MD Repeated studies leave little doubt that prayer has a salutary effect on recovery from illness. What is not as clear is the mechanism whereby this effect occurs. Religionists have no problem in attributing the effect of prayer to Divine benevolence, God’s responding to prayer. They struggle, however, with the problem of how a person’s prayer can cause God to act differently than He would have without the prayer. It is a tenet of faith that God does not undergo any change. Those who do not ascribe to Divine intervention say that the serenity and reassurance brought about by prayer are responsible for its effects. That emotions can affect disease and recovery is no longer debatable, and the mechanism whereby this occurs has essentially been elucidated. The effect of others praying for the patient can be similarly explained. However, the studies that show salutary effects of prayers for a patient even when the patient is unaware that he is being prayed for are more difficult to explain. Healing of the Soul:  A Prayer Program for the Elderly Pamela Elfenbein, PhD, MSW Rabbi Sholom D. Lipskar The Shul of Bal Harbour, under the direction of Rabbi Sholom Lipskar, conducts a program of service and prayer to enable residents of the Miami Jewish Home and Hospital for the Aged to experience healing by discovering their uniqueness and potentiality at the end of their lives. We shall discuss the project rationale from both secular and religious orientations and give an overview of the project and some case examples. The Problem of Meaning  in Long Term Care Robert Bergman, MD Family, work, and community provide meaning to a person’s life. How can we try to preserve an uprooted elder’s sense of meaning on his or her difficult day of moving into an assisted-living facility or a nursing home? A ritual called the New Horizon has been developed at the Miami Jewish Home to help the new resident experience meaning and continuity during the transition. The Challenge of Human Duality:  To Acknowledge Divine Unity Aaron Rabinowitz, PhD Our sages teach that the unity of God is the cardinal principle of Jewish theology. This idea is articulated most clearly by Rabbi Moshe Hayyim Luzzatto (Ramhal), who explains that God wishes to be accepted and crowned by beings who willingly and freely choose to do so. This is the reason for creation and the meaning of history. But how can evil exist alongside this unity? This paper explores the human role in this unfolding drama. What is the relevance of unity and duality in understanding the human personality? Is there a basic core to the human personality that dictates behavior, or are human actors forever changing character in response to the pressures of the moment? Psychologists are divided over this question. The Jewish point of view postulates a good and evil inclination, a divine and an animal soul struggling to dominate each person. The models of the Kabbalah, the Gaon of Vilna, Rabbi Hayyim of Volozhin, the Alter Rebbe, and the Ramhal will be discussed. Real and Ersatz Human Links to God Professor Menachem Kovacs The Maharal of Prague analyzed the dominant traits of the five major civilizations in which the Jewish people were exiled: Egypt, Babylon, Persia, Greece, and Rome. Although these cultures have disintegrated, their dominant traits are found in the ersatz attempts of secular Western societies to reach transcendence. The persecuted, lonely faithful Jew knows that true transcendence can be reached only by obeying the will of God. The Princeton Engineering Anomalies Research Project and Healing Prayer Professor Samuel W. Spero In this paper the experiments that have been conducted by the Princeton Engineering Anomalies Research Project will be described. These experiments have demonstrated that human consciousness can affect the random nature of certain physical devices. To explain these anomalous phenomena, the scientists associated with these experiments have introduced the concept of a consciousness field. These experiments can help us understand something about the mechanism of prayer and how we might do it more effectively. We shall describe their results and how these relate to the Jewish laws on formal and informal prayer, as well as the laws of communal prayer, and the concept of a minyan (prayer quorum). Self- Nullification: The Paradox of Surrender and Permanence Professor Gloria Pollack Bittul ha’yesh (self-nullification) is a teaching prominent and integral to Judaism, its literature, and its philosophy from biblical to modern times. The Sfat Emet stated, “the foundation for everything is bittul [submission] to the Creator.” I hope to briefly demonstrate the pervasiveness of self-nullification in Jewish thought: how it originated in the Bible and in the Oral Law, is prominent in rabbinic Judaism, mysticism, and Hasidism, and, lately, in contemporary scholarship. In the process, an attempt is made to unravel the many facets and paradoxes of this concept. Kosher Talebearing Seymour Hoffman, PhD The Torah forbids talebearing, and the Hafets Hayyim says that gossiping about other people—even if what is said is true—may cause the speaker and the listener to transgress thirty-one commandments. The Sages of the Talmud consider gossiping a sin equivalent to idolatry, murder, and prohibited sexual relations. Nevertheless, who doesn’t suffer from the urge to gossip? We present a suggestion based on a literary discussion group in Hungary of women who sublimated their urge to gossip by analyzing the characters in books they read. This could serve as a model for other groups to meet and discuss literature. This would extend the observation of the wife of Rabbi Nahman that “for everything prohibited by the Torah, there is something similar to it that is permitted”(Talmud Hulin 109b).

Space, Time, and Consciousness Professor Eliezer Zeiger Kabbalah and Hasidic philosophy describe two time dimensions: the time of the lower world and the time of the higher worlds. Lower time is symbolized by the new moon and the “years” in Pharaoh’s dreams as interpreted by Joseph. Higher time is symbolized by Shabbat and the “days” in the dreams of Pharaoh’s butler and baker as interpreted by Joseph. Lower time “flows,” with the past gone and the future yet to come. Higher time is eternal, with past, present, and future coexisting simultaneously. One aspect of the war of the Greeks against the Jews that ended in the Jewish victory celebrated in Hanukkah concerns the meaning of time. For the Greeks, time is a sequence of events, or its measurement. For the Jews, time is the injection of Divine Providence into space. Kabbalah and Hasidic philosophy teach us that time originates from two simultaneous rhythms: mati ve’lo mati, the movement of Divine energy from the higher to the lower realms; and ratso va’shov, the movement of the soul from the lower to the higher realms. The First Six Days of the Universe Professor Moshe Carmeli The early stage of the universe is discussed, and the time lengths of its first six days are given, as well as the age of the universe. There seems to be no contradiction with the biblical claim that the universe was created in six days. This same paper—from the book Astrophysical Edges and Time Scales, edited by Ted von Hippel, Chris Simpson, and Nadine Manset (Astronaumical Society of the Pacific), volumes 2-4-5, page 628—without reference to the Bible appears in astro-ph-0103008. Radioactive Rock Dating and the Age of the Earth Yaacov Hanoka, PhD This paper attempts to tackle the disparity between the age of the Earth that we derive from the Torah (about 5000 years) and what modern science claims (about five billion years). The method used by modern science for geochronology is radioactive rock dating. There are several key assumptions upon which the validity of radioactive rock dating is based. The principal one is that of a so-called closed system. Another important one is that the rock to be measured has not undergone significant heating after it has solidified. If these assumptions are not satisfied or adequately corrected, very large disparities in rock ages can occur. We shall take a detailed look at the assumptions underlying the potassium-argon rock dating method and a model that brings together Noah’s Flood and its associated effects of high pressure and high water temperature with implications for this dating method. An implication of the model is that all the radioactive clocks could have been reset at the time of the Flood. The Unity of Time Tsvi Victor Saks, PhD Jewish time can be seen as a unity from several perspectives. Past, present, and future coexist and influence each other, primarily through tshuvah (return, or repentance). By doing tshuvah, a Jew’s current regret for past actions retroactively affects and transforms his past, either lessening the effect of misdeeds or transforming them into merits. The Lubavitcher Rebbe teaches a more complex model, in which the potential for tshuvah is already present in the past misdeed. Thus, the past implicitly influences the future, and when that potential for tshuvah is manifested in the present life of the Jew, then the past is transformed, in a cyclical pattern. A mathematical model of time and change from the Theory of Topological Dynamics will be discussed. In this theory, there is (i) a time component T (topological group); (ii) a universe component U (topological space); and (iii) a mapping f:T x U - > U, in which each moment of time represents a rearrangement of the universe U. We shall examine various properties of this mathematical model and evaluate them in the context of Jewish time: (1) The structure of T implies that one can naturally move from any one point in time to any other point in time; and (2) f is continuous, which implies that change is gradual. Does Time Begin? An Elucidation of the Lubavitcher Rebbe’s Comments on the Topic Rabbi Tzvi Freeman This paper consists of three parts: An annotated translation of a letter by Rabbi Mena h em Mendel Schneerson, the Lubavitcher Rebbe, on the nature of time An annotated translation of a letter by the Rebbe on relativity An essay by Rabbi Tzvi Freeman explaining the letters and relating them to other writings by the Rebbe The Garden of the Self Professor Vera Schwarcz How we understand history shapes our understanding of the human predicament in general—and of Jewish destiny in particular. Drawing upon comparative insights from the Chinese tradition, this essay argues for a rooted sense of historical consciousness. In a modern world riddled by amnesia, Jews stand out as a reminder of a vibrant, vivifying connection to the past. The garden is used as a metaphor to show how the soil of remembrance nurtures enduring traditions—especially for Jews who have survived repeated attempts to destroy their attachment to historical memory. What Is ‘I’?  Using Maimonides’ Guide to the Perplexed in Modern Physics Professor Ruvin Ferber The exclusion of human consciousness from its context has made science immanently incomplete and has caused strange paradoxes. The two major paradoxes of quantum physics are: (1) the entanglement of particles separated by great distances that have no force connecting them; (2) the instantaneous collapse of a system into a certain outcome of a measurement. John von Neumann attributes the second paradox to the interaction of the system with the individual “I of a conscious observer.” An important clue to the harmonious resolution of both paradoxes may be obtained by adapting the philosophical system of Maimonides’ The Guide of the Perplexed. Maimonides gives logical proof that the interconnection of all reality is a result of the simultaneous creation of the physical and human world by the Creator: “all that exists is like one individual whose parts are bound up with each other.” Who Am I? Torah and Psychological Definitions of Self Professor Menachem Kovacs Definitions of self are fundamental in both Torah and sociology, which share major areas of convergence as well as divergence. I shall examine concepts of self found in both the revealed and the hidden parts of the Torah as well as in the thought of classical sociologists like Max Weber and Karl Marx, and contemporary sociologists like C. Wright Mills and Robert Wuthnow. I shall also examine the complementary but different Hasidic concepts of the Godly soul and the collective self. Finally, sociologist Philip Wexler’s paradigm of mystical sociology will be explained as a novel attempt to fuse sociology and mysticism to better explain and understand the nature of humans and society. Wexler’s explanation of “re-selfing” brilliantly integrates the work of social science and religion to posit a vision of self and society, transformed from alienation to personal and collective redemption. The Exodus and Egyptian Historiography Rabbi Berl Haskelevich Moving certain segments of Egyptian history forward by a few centuries would allow full correlation between the account of the Exodus in the Bible and Egyptian historiography. This is a hypothesis still in the research stage. We await new developments in the field. A Calculation of the Israelite Population at Mount Sinai Solomon Dinkevich, PhD This paper uses the information found in the Torah to calculate the size of the Jewish families during their 210 years in Egypt until the Exodus. We shall show that the growth of the Israelites from the seventy members of our patriarch Jacob’s family to ten to twelve million people over 210 years may be reached with an average of six to eighteen children per family—normal family sizes even by modern standards. Entering the Sabbath of History Aaron Leib Dukes, MSc Torah sages have termed the current and previous generations the “Friday afternoon” of God’s “week-long” plan for “this world.” This is based on the concept that a day in God’s time equals a thousand years in human time. Just as God created the world in six days and rested on the seventh, so, too, there are to be six millennia of human history and then a seventh, entirely different millennium that will elevate the previous six thousand years to holiness. The Hebrew calendar starts with the sixth day of Creation, when God breathed spiritual life into Adam. Starting from there, the Friday afternoon of human history should have started in the Hebrew year 5750 (1990 CE). Before then, however, Torah sages had already proclaimed that we had entered Friday afternoon. Examination of the Torah sources leads to the conclusion that the formula “G-d’s day = 1000 years” is only a first-order approximation. I present here two attempts to reach a more precise definition of the human-year equivalence of the length of “God’s years.” One attempt is based on Nahmanides’ commentary that each of the six millennia is a thematic epoch of events corresponding to its Creation day counterpart. This suggests a value somewhat smaller than a thousand years for one of God’s days, which is then found to have confirmation in fundamental historical events and eras not mentioned by Nahmanides, occurring as “predicted” by the smaller value. The second attempt is made by finding which Divine day length maximizes the concordance of expected transition points (sunset, midnight, sunrise, and noon of the Divine day) with dates of important historical events, as indicated independently in the authoritative compilation of Jewish chronology, Seder Ha’Dorot . The precise Divine plan directing history becomes strikingly apparent when viewed in this way. Conclusion: It is already time to prepare for the seventh “day” of messianic redemption. Torah, Reality, and the Scientific Model— Removing the Blindfold of Scientism Elliot Pines, Ph.D. Torah and science agree on a general, abstract level. Where it appears that there are irreconcilable differences, their essence can be traced to a hidden or manifest scientism—the belief that science is an all-inclusive explanation of reality. The aim of this paper is to demonstrate both in theoretical and empirical terms the falsity of scientism and to replace it with a complete and unified “working model” based upon the Torah. I intend to show that a finite model can never encompass the totality of absolute reality. I shall do this by surveying how philosophers, scientists, and mathematicians through the centuries have treated the views of the Torah and of Zeno of Elea’s paradoxes on the structure of reality. The three major views surveyed are (1) causality versus chance; (2) finitude versus infinity; (3) reducibility versus irreducible complexity. I further suggest that a Torah-based model of looking at reality from above to below fulfills the requirement of the “oracle” needed to provide true information from the transfinite to the finite, as proven by Alan Turing. The Psychology and Religion of Tahorah and Holiness Professor Zecharia Dor-Shav By studying Maimonides’ definition of tahorah (ritual purity), 1 a unifying principle and psychological relevance for this concept may be reached. Being in a state of tahorah enables a person to give maximum glory to God, thus fulfilling the highest purpose of human life. The state of tahorah gives access to the state of holiness. Tahorah also may serve as a symbolic medium that motivates a person toward self-actualization. This also requires that the individual is a member of a constructive social group; has exemplary role models; has good leadership; and knows how to make conscious distinctions regarding his or her time, place, and existential state. The obverse state of tahorah is tumah. Tumah may be described as a state resulting from contact with a creature whose quality of life has been lowered by death, misuse, or an impediment to procreation. Tumah can also result from contact with penitent offerings of idolaters or of leaders who violated the public trust. How Much Water Has to Flow into the Mikveh?  A Mathematical Solution Professor Yaakov Yavin Mishnah 3 of chapter 3 of Tractate Mikvaot states that a hypothetical mikveh is disqualified “until it is calculated” that there is less than three log of its original drawn water remaining. The mishnah does not explain how the calculation should be made. Using high school mathematics, I am suggesting a way to make this calculation. In Desperate Pursuit of Motherhood:  Another Perspective on the Sotah Judith Geudalia, PhD Yocheved Debow, MA The sotah (suspected adulteress) is a topic of much discussion in the Torah and Talmud. The basic level of the discussion is the process by which a jealous husband and the kohanim (priests) deal with a wife suspected of violating the sanctity of marriage by infidelity. Through examining the Torah and Talmud texts, we wish to present an additional perspective on this difficult topic. Our suggested approach reveals the empathy and compassion of the God and the Torah for a woman in desperate pursuit to have a child. The Tablets of the Ten Commandments and Laser Technology Mikhail M. Agrest, PhD Matest Agrest, Dr. Sci. According to the Mishnah[1] the legendary shamir , the ktav , the mikhtav , and the tablets of the Ten Commandments were created at twilight before the first Sabbath. The Talmud[2] and Rashi[3] say that the shamir was used to split the stones of the First Temple. According to Rashi, the mikhtav was the stylus with which the letters (the ktav) were engraved on the tablets of the Ten Commandments. In the Talmud, Rabbi H isda[4] marvels at how the letters cut through the entire thickness of the tablets of the Ten Commandments and appeared in mirror image on the posterior side. Rabbi H isda maintains it was a miracle that the center portions of the square-shaped final letter mem and the elliptical shaped samekh stayed in place. Although by definition miracles do not have to be explained as scientifically observable phenomena, Rabbi H isda’s description matches the way a laser can cut letters through stone. We suggest that the shamir was a laser that cut the letters by its mikhtav (a ray).

Time, Space, and Being: An Introduction Rabbi Sholom D. Lipskar The hard sciences have found that the human brain is wired to perform spiritual functions such as prayer and faith in God that are beyond its cognitive and nerve activity. Although spiritual behavior is manifested in the brain there is an inner, non-physical force that directs it. Every human being is connected to a transcendent Being Who cannot be comprehended or apprehended within the temporal, spatial dimension of the brain. There is yedi a t ha’metsiut , the knowledge of God’s Being, and yedi a t ha’mahut , the knowledge of God’s essence. Though we know that a spiritual reality exists, we do not really know its essence. Faith is real and arises from its potential to kinetic state at the moment of need. If it were not intrinsically there, it could not arise. Why suddenly think about G o d if you did not previously believe? At an experiential level, recognizing the neshama , the spiritual being in us, is real! When not activated by extreme events, a person must be open and willing to revitalize his or her soul. You must open the door to let spirituality in. Psychoneuroimmunology:  The Science Connecting Body and Mind Yakir Kaufman, MD The Torah gave the world an understanding of the reciprocal connections between body and soul. Until recently, many scientists rejected the concept that psychological factors and well-being can affect health and disease. In part, this may been caused by a lack of technological tools to prove these links. During the last decade, new methods and findings in neuroscience, neuroimaging, and molecular biology have discovered connections between emotions and disease, between the brain and the immune system, the mind and the body. Science and medicine are beginning to become aware of this interplay. The psycho-neuro-immunology (PNI) revolution uplifts science from a mechanistic, dualistic, reductionistic Descartian view of the human state to a more integrative perception of the complexity and beauty of human existence. PNI deals with the interactions among the mind, human behavior, the nervous system, the immune system, and the endocrine system. Understanding these complex interactions is essential for gaining a better understanding on how to maintain health and to prevent and treat disease. PNI guides science to the holistic view of body and soul interaction found in the Torah. Neurotheology Professor Carlos Warter, MD The human brain is wired to experience non-ordinary states of consciousness. We can reveal the mystical aspects of the self. Current research validates this assumption long maintained by spiritual and religious personalities and writings. We are spiritual beings having a human experience. As the receptors in our brain and consciousness begin to be uncovered, we can evidence this phenomenon with scientific data. Initiation or activation of the determinate circuitry in our synaptic brain system allow for the subjective experience of God. Research in meditation and prayer has opened the door to the new field of Neurotheology. Study of this field promises a deeper understanding of the purpose of human existence, which the mystics and saintly individuals of many traditions have tried to explain to us for centuries. Judging Genes Professor Miryam Z. Wahrman Jews have traditionally been willing subjects in genetic research; however, now there is some concern that Jewish people have been stigmatized due to the discovery of a host of defective genes that are prevalent in the Ashkenazi Jewish population. In fact, many other distinct ethnic groups carry unique genetic legacies that include specific genetic disorders. Screening of the Jewish population through programs such as Dor Yeshorim has reduced the number of children born with genetic disorders. In addition, new technologies such as preimplantation genetic diagnosis provide a mechanism, within the parameters of halakhah, for Jewish couples to ensure the birth of healthy children. Gene therapy may provide another approach sanctioned by rabbinic sources to alleviate the suffering of, and perhaps even cure, children born with genetic disorders. Studies on unique groups, including specific Jewish populations, will continue to contribute invaluable data and lead to a more complete understanding of genetic mechanisms of disease and human development. Organic Evolution in the Twenty-First Century Lee M. Spetner, PhD The consentient view of the mechanism of evolution has been that evolution proceeds by long series of small steps, in each of which the mutation is a single nucleotide substitution. Serious doubts, however, are now being expressed by molecular geneticists that long series of small, random, point mutations can be effective in evolution. Attention is instead being transferred to genetic rearrangements, which effect large genomic changes, and which do not appear to be random. These large mutations include insertions, inversions, and deletions, and they have been found in cases studied to be adaptive to the environment. How do they arise? There is as yet no satisfactory answer to this question. If these large changes are adaptive in a new environment, could they be triggered by that environment? Such an interpretation is being resisted, but it is a reasonable hypothesis. It would account for the observations. A theory to account for the evolution of life is now more elusive than it was in the past. On the Interface: Immutable Torah, Unchanging Laws of Nature, Ever Changing Understanding of these Laws Rabbi Professor Moshe D. Tendler This paper will address the current societal sentiment that science and technology are on a collision course with the truth of our Torah. Knowledge of science, however, is necessary to properly perform a number of Torah commandments. The fundamental truths of our Torah, such as: a) the utility of all that G-d created; and b) the infallibility of our Sages in matters of religion but not in secular science, have come under attack by our antagonists. On the other hand, the yeshiva world unfortunately is retreating from the natural world. We need to return to believing in the unity of Ha’Shem Elokim, the God of nature and Torah. Man Bites Dog Stan Tenen Science tells us that “it” comes from “bit”—that the world is based on information—and that information is based on contrast. We know that contrast attracts our attention, and we know further that what catches our attention also engages our awareness and self-awareness. Our awareness and our self-awareness enable us to decide how we shall act in response to what has attracted our attention. Thus, awareness and self-awareness are also driven by high contrast. The opening line of the Shma tells us that everything comes from the One Highest Contrast:God, Ha’Shem Elokim. The Extreme Longevity of the Early Generations in Genesis Professor Nathan Aviezer The Torah speaks of people who lived for more than 900 years, culminating in Methusaleh, who died at the age of 969. These Genesis accounts seem to be completely impossible, in view of the centenarian life spans observed today with the availability of modern medical care. What happened in the past to account for the extreme ages recorded in Genesis? Why did such long life spans cease at the time of the Exodus from Egypt? What is required to reintroduce extreme longevity into the human experience? We shall present recent discoveries that indicate that scientists are finally beginning to understand the process of biological aging, and the functioning of the “biological clock” that governs the life span of all living creatures. Reports in the recent scientific literature speak of the possibility of human beings living “for many hundreds of years, in good health.” This new scientific understanding of the aging process has shown that there is no barrier to human life spans of 1000 years. Thus, we find yet another instance of harmony between science and the Torah. Human Aging: The Journey of Soul Return Rabbi Arthur Seltzer, PhD The Jewish mystical tradition sees old age in a very positive light. Aging is not seen as a defect to be eliminated by medical science. Old age presents the opportunity for the divine soul to assert primacy over the animal soul. A Torah observant Jew who has consciously worked on his or her necessary tikkun (moral repair) through prayer and mitsvot (commandments) can reach the highest level of knowledge attainable only at old age. This highest level of being a zaken she bi’kdusha (an elderly in holiness) is connected to the crown of the kabbalistic spheres and to the patriarchs and radiates an increasing exaltation, uplifting other people also. Reb Nathan, the discipline of Rebbe Nahman of Breslov, wrote extensively on how we are transformed as we age. The Jungian school of psychology and the Ayurvedic medical tradition also accept and respect old age as a necessary passage in the journey of life. The Baal Shem Tov, the founder of Hasidism, reached such a pure state of knowledge at the end of his life that he was able to consciously and peacefully guide his followers to the sublime moment of his soul’s return to its Source. Celestial Voyaging to Planet Earth:  Space, Time, and Being in the Context of Space Flight Professor James E. Huchingson The space-time continuum of Einstein’s General Theory of Relativity is universally pictured as a rubberized sheet, warped, and contorted into various shapes. This geometric image “spatializes” time, thereby robbing it of its basic character as true temporal process. An alternative view may be found in the irreducible historical character of time based on the divine-human encounter found in Abrahamic religions. Here, the profound emphasis is on time as event, rather than duration; and space as place, rather than extension. Being, in turn, becomes process, rather than static existence. It is the “taking place” of unique transforming encounters. The biblical journey is made by a chosen people through the wilderness to a homeland, a place of singular importance. In contrast to this, human flight into outer space is the impoverished experience of encapsulated entombment in a vessel as it endures passage through the homogeneous space-time continuum on its way to heaven knows where. Ironically, the most transforming event of the space program has been the discovery of the fullness of the Earth viewed from afar on the way to somewhere else. For some time to come, our precious, fragile, and imperiled home planet, not the moon or Mars, will remain both the origin and destination of our celestial journeying, and the key to our understanding of time, space, and being. Biosphere as a Microsphere Aryeh Gotfryd, PhD Abraham may well have been the first systems analyst. His independent discovery of an absolute, omniscient, omnipotent, and omnipresent creator and sustainer was inferred (if not deduced) from his observations of the heavenly bodies and life on earth. He observed that for any object or system comprised of coordinated components, where each component has no control over the other, it is reasonable to surmise that there is a factor external to the components possessing information and power over the components to coordinate them systematically. Since every object and system at every scale may be seen as conforming to this description, one may say about the universe as a whole that it is an integrated, functioning system having a controlling factor external to and more powerful than it. This all-powerful and controlling factor is normally referred to as \"God.\" The modern science of ecology is holistic in its recognition of ecosystems as integrated phenomena with each whole being more than the sum of its parts. Consequently, ecologists are significantly predisposed to adopt Abraham's conclusion that the ecosphere and cosmos testify to that grand Unifier we call “God.” Judaism and the Modern Concept of Sustainability Akiva Wolff, PhD The growing awareness of the negative effects of modern technological development has generated interest in “sustainability.” Sustainability can be defined as ensuring that human actions do not jeopardize the long-term availability and quality of environmental resources. Is there a uniquely Jewish perspective on the sustainability discourse? On the one hand, environmental protection is an important aspect—albeit sometimes overlooked—of Jewish observance. Jewish law helps create a sustainable society by balancing environmental considerations with the economic and social needs of society, both in the long and short terms. Development is encouraged, but regulated by Jewish law in a way that attempts to maximize protection of the environment and conserve resources. On the other hand, the principle of preserving the environment at all costs is at odds with Jewish belief, which does not view this world as being eternal, and which places supreme value on the immediate preservation of human life, even at the cost of what we call sustainability. Torah and Photosynthesis: The Blueprint of Creation Mordechai (Marc) Olesky Both Torah and science describe the primary forces that interact continuously to create the material world. The first ten lines of Genesis describe the creation of the four elemental forces—air, fire, water, and earth, the constituents of all inorganic and organic matter. These elements come into existence from the breath of God, through His Ten Utterances of Genesis, composed of the twenty-two letters of the Hebrew alphabet. According to the science of ecology, the primary forces of nature that determine the abundance and distribution of life are wind currents, the sun and the energy it provides, the hydrological cycle, and soil. These systems can be understood as the macrocosmic expressions of air, fire, water, and earth. Aspects of each of them interact in the carbon cycle, the dual processes of photosynthesis and respiration. The reactants of photosynthesis are carbon dioxide, water, and sunlight, in the presence of chlorophyll. The total number of protons in a single molecule of water is ten and in carbon dioxide, twenty-two. These numbers correlate with the number of Utterances and the Hebrew letters that create and maintain the world. A further numerical correlation is in the number of basic units—the Torah has fifty-four weekly portions; the complete formula for photosynthesis has fifty-four atoms. Manna as an Environmental Paradigm Manfred Gerstenfeld, PhD The biblical narrative of manna and its interpretation throughout the centuries illustrate several environmental principles, such as the prevention of waste and pollution and the avoidance of over-consumption, as well as durability and cleanliness. Religious, moral, and spiritual motifs are frequently intertwined with environmental ones. Jewish literature through the ages expresses diverse views on the nature of manna. It is viewed by some as material food given by God while by others as spiritual nourishment. The story of manna may be read as a biblical environmental text. The Jewish view of the environment differs, however, from that of modern environmental perception. Manfred Gerstenfeld, PhD and Tsachi Golan Judaism versus Homosexuality:  A Historical, Religious, and Psychological Review Nathaniel S. Lehrman, MD This paper examines why the traditional Jewish ban on homosexuality is correct. Historically, Judaism was the first faith to ban homosexuality, which the entire ancient world accepted. That ban, retained by its daughter religions, Christianity and Islam, channeled sexual activity into the marital bed, thus totally transforming family life. Sex became the spousal bond of faithful, passionate love underlying the stable families within which the products of that sexual love are best raised. Religiously, the defiance and promiscuity characterizing the American homosexual political movement are the total opposites of the Jewish traditions of fidelity and lawfulness. While we may not always be able to control our sexual feelings, responsibility for our sexual behavior rests entirely upon us. Sexual criminals—homosexuals, pederasts and rapists—represented the heart of the Nazi party, as was well recognized then. Indeed, German-Jewish historian Samuel Igra's 1945 book, Germany's National Vice , suggests that the key reason for Hitler's uniquely vicious anti-Semitism was Judaism's dedication to the Law, especially concerning sexuality. Through a little-recognized form of Holocaust revisionism, however, the American homosexual political movement has skillfully transformed the public perception of Nazi era homosexuals from vicious criminals to innocent victims. Helpmates: Mother and Father as Cotherapy Model Seymour Hoffman, PhD A successful husband-wife and father-mother relationship of two opposite personalities that attract, complement, and help one another serves as the model for dialectical cotherapy. Both children and therapy clients benefit from receiving the contrasting behaviors of their parents and cotherapists. Since the demands, responsibilities, and challenges are great, choosing the right helpmate is vital. That is why the Torah says that before Eve, Adam was missing his ezer k’negdo, the help of the right oppositional force for him. On Controlling Urges Seymour Hoffman, PhD In regard to the highly sensitive issue of how to relate and react to a religious homosexual from a religious and psychological perspective, Joel B. Wolowelsky and Bernard L. Weinstein make the following cogent point: “Halacha focuses on the ability to withdraw from executing a natural impulse, not from feeling the impulse itself. A young man who has homosexual thoughts but…can control his actions is not ill. But a person who has an irresistible compulsion to act against his values does need psychological help irrespective of the nature of the compulsion. Thus even in cases where homosexual desire is long-standing and defines a deep and apparently unalterable aspect of the personality, Halacha calls us to the heroic act of renunciation.” Jerusalem College of Technology Havaad Haleumi 21, Givat Mordechai 91160, Jerusalem Phone: 02-6751111 OR *3239 Info and Registration: 1-700-50-32-32 Department for Development & External Affairs: 02-6751269 English Program: 02-6751011 For development queries: development@jct.ac.il For Education verification and student queries: maztal@jct.ac.il For queries for the English speaking program: esp@jct.ac.il Video Live Updates on Facebook ‏Jerusalem college of technology 5785 © All rights reserved to Jerusalem College of Technology - Lev Academic Center by: www.TWB.co.il × Need more information?

And God Said, “Let There Have Been a Big Bang” Avi Rabinowitz, PhD This article is an excerpt from the author’s book The Instant Universe , which points out that both the scientific and traditional origin accounts follow from their respective implicit fundamental assumptions. As the assumptions of one system are not provable within the realm of the other, the validity of one of these accounts should not be considered as negating the validity of the other. Not only is there no logical dissonance in accepting the validity of both, but the scientific origin theory could be considered as one of the ways of describing God’s creation of the universe and therefore as one of the traditional 70 facets of the Creation account. The following excerpt shows how central elements of the traditional understanding of the origins of existence can be seen to follow from its conception of the purposive creation of a universe containing a free-willed moral consciousness. Among other things, this approach shows why the differing conclusions of science and tradition on when the universe began are to be expected. On the Age of the Universe Alexander Poltorak, PhD According to the traditional Jewish calendar based on the Talmud, the universe is less than six thousand years old. The cosmological models of the universe, supported by abundant empirical data, place the age of the universe at twelve to fifteen billion years. In Part One, critical examination of both views is presented. In Part Two, we consider the quantum-mechanical state of matter before and after the introduction of a conscious observer. The role of the observer’s free will is examined. The definitions of physical and proto-physical states of matter are proposed. It is suggested that creation of the first conscious being with free will lead to the collapse of the global quantum wave function, thereby bringing the world from a proto-physical to a physical state. We propose that the total cosmological age of the universe is comprised of two periods: (1) proto-physical on the order of twelve to fifteen billion years; (2) physical, which is no longer than the period of time during which there has been a conscious human observer. This thesis is used to reconcile the biblical and scientific views on the age of the universe. It is also used to reconcile a long- standing controversy between the pre- and post-Lurianic schools of Kabbala regarding sabbatical cycles. Observer and the System of Reference: A Unified View Professor Ruvin Ferber Professor Herman Branover Is our picture of the physical world dependent on the condition of our observation—or, more specifically, on our choice of a particular system of reference used to describe the physical world? This question will be discussed from the points of view of (1) traditional Jewish opinions based on the Torah and (2) contemporary trends in physics. Although Einstein’s General Relativity Theory is based on the postulate that all physical laws in all systems of reference are equal, the problem of choosing the reference system that gives the ”truest” picture of the universe still remains. There are two different ways to choose a system of reference. According to the first approach, the system of coordinates in which a phenomenon is described by simpler mathematical expressions gives its “real” (or even the “correct”) expression. For example, the equations describing the motion of the Earth are simplest when the system of reference is attached to the sun. This easier calculation may incline one to think that the heliocentric picture is the ultimately true picture of reality. Indeed, in contradiction to the Torah view, Newtonian science considers the sun the center of the universe. The second approach consists of choosing a reference system connected with an observer. This approach plays an exclusive role in the interpretation of quantum mechanics, one of the most important and successful theories of the twentieth century. Key quantum physicists such as John von Neumann and Eugene Wigner uphold that the conscious observer has a central role in sustaining physical reality. Their concept that our conscious selves are the most important things in the universe, moreover, is in full agreement with the opinions expressed in the Torah and the literature based on the Torah. Give Me a Place to Stand! To Prove that the Earth is the Center of the Universe Professor Juris Zakis Is it reasonable to speak about something that we are not able to observe? When I jump, may I say that I am pushing the Earth away if all the observers who see me jumping do not feel the Earth moving away with them? We are always ready to argue that our actions cause something to move relative to the firm supporting point of the ever-resting Earth. The Earth is the base not only for mechanical actions (as illustrated above) but also for all our life activity. It is our home, our motherland, our nurse, and keeper. It was created by the Lord and is our sole material base. Creation and the Symbiosis of Science and Judaism Professor Norbert Samuelson It seems to me that the critical questions that science and natural philosophy raise for Jewish theology are the following: Does God evolve? Does the universe have or even need an interpretation, specifically with reference to the fact that most of the universe most of the time is uninhabitable, and there may be many more than one universe? Does the universe need a beginning? What is distinctive about human consciousness, intelligence, and ethics in the light of evidence for evolution from all of the life sciences? Finally, will both life and the universe end? These questions are not only modern. They contain all the primary issues that have dominated rabbinic thought. That agenda can be summarized in six topics: How should we model what we believe about (1) God, (2) the world, and (3) the human being; and how should we understand the relations between them, viz., between (4) G-d and the world (or, Creation), (5) God and the human (or, revelation), and (6) the human and the world (or, redemption). In this paper I shall focus only on the fourth issue, Creation. My answer is presented in detail in my Judaism and the Doctrine of Creation (Cambridge University Press, 1994). Here I shall summarize my conclusions concerning science, Jewish texts, and the correlation between them. Genesis 1 Speaks about the Creation of Prophecy,  Not the Creation of the World Russell Jay Hendel, PhD This paper defends a novel interpretation of Genesis 1 that facilitates resolution of the apparent contradiction between science, which holds that the universe is 20 billion years old, and the traditional interpretation of Genesis 1, which posits that the world is 6000 years old. The primary contribution of this paper is the introduction of a comprehensive methodology of symbolic interpretation that allows objective evaluation of whether a text is symbolic. Using these symbolic methods, we defend the position that Genesis 1 does not describe the creation of the physical world, but rather describes the creation of prophecy—in other words, the primary intent of Genesis 1-3 is to inform us that 6000 years ago the first communication from God to a human happened to a person named Adam. Continental Drift, Asteroid Impacts, and the Flood Yaacov Hanoka, PhD The leading paradigm in modern geology is continental drift and plate tectonics. The surface of the Earth is viewed as being a series of plates that move relative to one another. At one time all connected together, the continents are now separated and still slightly moving as part of this plate movement. Paleontologists today widely accept the Alvarez Theory of a massive asteroid impact to explain the sudden demise of dinosaurs as well as numerous other fauna and flora. The mass of such an asteroid has been estimated as up to 1013 kilograms. There is now strong evidence that the location of the impact crater is the Yucatan Peninsula. Investigation of Torah commentary on the Flood leads to some remarkable conclusions and predictions regarding these recent findings in geology and paleontology. A midrash in Genesis Rabba clearly states that the continents were connected prior to Noah’s Flood, and later commentaries assert that the seasons of the year began only after the Flood. The Talmud in tractate Rosh Hashana elaborates on extraterrestrial causes (i.e., possible asteroids) of the Flood. Taking these Torah sources along with the conclusions of some of these scientific findings, it is possible to construct a broad qualitative model that potentially could explain a wide diversity of phenomena. For example, the model explains why the Yucatan Peninsula is the location of the impact crater and how the 23.5 degree tilt of the Earth’s axis relative to the plane of the ecliptic may have come about. Also, the model can explain the major distributions of microtektites throughout the world. If verified by some of its predictions, this model could clearly have very significant implications for the Torah/science interplay. Given the validity of the model, the issue of reconciling radioactive rock dating with the chronology of the Torah needs to be addressed, and some approaches to this will be presented. Richard Dawkins and Darwinian Fundamentalism Professor Nathan Aviezer A surprisingly large number of books dealing with science have been published in recent years. Aimed at the educated layman, some of these books have proven so popular that they have even become bestsellers. One would think that professional scientists would applaud this development, but popularity is not always the most desired goal. Unfortunately, many of these best-selling books have their science seriously in error. Nowhere is this problem more acutely felt than in the field of evolutionary biology, as will be seen in this paper on Richard Dawkins’s approach to Darwinism. Review of Not by Chance: Review of Not by Chance:  Shattering the Modern Theory of Evolution by Dr. Lee Spetner Professor Edward Simon Different Levels of Infinity in Torah and Mathematics Tsvi Victor Saks, PhD The Lubavitcher Rebbe, Rabbi Menahem Mendel Schneerson writes1 that the Zohar predicted that from 1840 there would be great advances in the secular sciences and Jewish mystical knowledge, in order to ready the world for the messianic era. The Rebbe states that the deepest level of positive interaction between secular knowledge (science and mathematics) and Torah occurs when secular knowledge is used to explain and illuminate deep concepts in Jewish mysticism. In this paper, we will use mathematical infinity to clarify the concept of infinity as discussed in Torah. The concept of infinity is used in Torah in two fundamentally different ways. First, G-d is referred to as Ain Sof , literally, Without End, or Infinite. On the other hand, the Torah has revealed the fact that the creation is infinite (Talmud H agiga , many references in Hasidism and Kabbala). For example, God created infinitely many spiritual worlds, and infinitely many troops of hosts that serve Him. Now surely the concept of infinity as it relates to and describes the creation is vastly inferior to the concept of Infinity as it applies to God Himself. In fact, all of God’s infinitely many troops are considered as absolutely nothing before Him. How can infinity be limited? The modern theory of mathematical infinity, first introduced by G. Cantor in the 1870’s, provides a useful framework to describe both a concept of infinity that actually exists and is limited (the created universe), and a qualitatively higher concept of Infinity which is unlimited. The mechanisms which mathematics uses to distinguish between different levels of infinity will be discussed, and a fundamental theorem is proven. Mathematical infinity is a powerful example of science clarifying a deep concept in Torah, and of science supporting a controversial Torah statement about the creation. A System of Logic for Messianic Phenomena Professor Shimon Silman Classically, natural phenomena are described by a 2-valued logic. In the writings of Hasidism and Kabbala we find that the phenomena of the messianic era are characterized by a paradoxical combined natural-and-miraculous world order. 2-valued logic is inadequate to describe such phenomena. Thus it is suggested that a 3-valued logic be used as a model for these messianic phenomena. First introduced in the 1920's, 3-valued logics are now in common use in some computer languages and have been suggested as models for the paradoxical phenomena of quantum mechanics. This paper is based on research done at the Rabbi Yisroel Aryeh Leib Research Institute on Moshiach and the Sciences, of which the author is director. It is dedicated to the memory of Rabbi Yisroel Aryeh Leib ben Rabbi Levi Yitzchok Schneerson, whose fiftieth yartseit will be observed on 13 Iyyar this year. Artificial, Human, and Infinite Intelligence Professor Yossef Marcio Zukin Scientists increasingly perceive how imprecision is inherent in all physical systems. Through fuzzy logic, which uses artificial intelligence, it is possible to simulate human intelligence and model the ways in which human beings organize information and reason with it, even when it is vague. Encompassing the one eternal truth, the Torah knows that human life is not “black” or “white.” The Torah recognizes human imprecision and different degrees of understanding and observing vast precepts. This paper endeavors to show how the new viewpoint of science in dealing with imprecise information is moving toward that of the infinite intelligence of the Torah. In normal set theory, an object is either a member of a set or not. There are only two states: “0” or “1,” “yes” or “no,” and so on. In fuzzy set theory, an object can be a member of a set to a certain degree . Science is accepting its own imprecision and dependence on the observer, who not only reasons with opposites, but uses different gradations, to define concepts, such as “almost good.” The Code of Jewish Law gives clear halakhic guidelines for every situation, including eating, praying, and conducting business. Yet, the Torah commandment “to be holy,” implies a set of imprecise ways of observing all the other laws with different membership degrees to this set. There is “right” and “wrong,” but many other levels between them also exist, since “right” can be divided into many different and qualitative degrees. Mathematical Drash Ari Belenkiy, PhD Investigating the imaginative potential of classical medieval midrashim (hermeneutic literature), we show how models and language from the comparatively new mathematical disciplines of Algebraic Topology and Riemannian geometry can provide a natural language for the discussion of various philosophical questions raised in midrashim. Finding God in the Study of the Sociology of Religion Professor Menachem Kovacs This paper selects key terms and concepts from the study of the sociology of religion to show how this science can reveal some basic and useful concepts in spirituality. Lactational Amenorrhea and Mesuleket Damim— a Medical Halakhic Analysis Deena R. Zimmerman, MD Lactational amenorrhea, or the lack of menstruation during the time a woman is breastfeeding, has important implications in Jewish law. The Talmudic sources and laws based on them describe a non-menstruating time period of two years. This seems to contradict current common experience of much shorter periods of lack of menses during breastfeeding. The goal of this paper is to analyze the Jewish sources in light of modern knowledge of lactation. Rabbinic Insights into Behavior Change Seymour Hoffman, PhD Rabbi Yehoshua Hacarmi Jewish sages had profound psychological wisdom and insight into human behavior and pathology and how to affect and modify them. This essay gives a cognitive-behavioral interpretation of the insights several Jewish biblical commentators had of psychology. The attitude of the rabbis toward the use of manipulation in effecting change in people who are in distress is also discussed, with the aid of rabbinical “clinical single session therapy” vignettes. Probabilistic Analysis of the ‘Torah Codes’: A False Premise? Professor Isaac Elishakoff Counting the letters of the Torah and finding specific patterns in the Torah text is part of the Jewish tradition. The use of computers has enabled more elaborate searches to find patterns or ‘codes,’ especially by equidistant letter skips and the performance of quantitative checks. The promulgators of the ‘hidden codes’ employ quantitative analysis to claim how miniscule the probabilities are of the ‘codes’ appearing by chance. They conclude that the 'codes' could only been implanted by the Divine Author. Opponents to these conclusions have found similar patterns in other literary texts. One can argue that all texts are written by Divine inspiration. On the other hand, as Professor A.M. Hasofer stresses, one ought “not forget that bitter experience has taught us that misinterpretations of our Holy Torah have often resulted in the past in disaster and catastrophe for our people.” My paper has a humble objective. I question the very use of probabilistic methods to analyze the significance of equidistant letter sequence Torah ‘codes’ by both their proponents and opponents. The reason is that in order to apply probabilistic methods the existence of multiple “Torahs” would have to be assumed—inadvertently or deliberately. Can one randomize Torah, as the supporters of the Torah ‘codes’ in effect suggest, and to which the opponents to the Torah ‘codes’ seemingly do not object? Lending without Interest in a Jewish State Raphael Yehezkael This article describes a dream inspired by the verse: “If thou lend money to My people, even to the poor with thee, thou shalt not be to him as a creditor; neither shall ye lay upon him interest” (Exodus 22:24). Prayers of the Mothers for the Rebuilding of the Temple Yael Levine Katz, PhD The following prayers were written by Yael Levine Katz as part of a larger work in Hebrew entitled Tehinnat Ha’Nashim Le’Vinyan Ha’Mikdash , published by the Eked Publishing House in Tel Aviv, 1996. Written in the style of aggadic midrash, this creative work offers the supplications of great Jewish women from biblical times through the end of the Second Temple to G-d to rebuild the Temple. Drawn from biblical, talmudic, midrashic, and aggadic literature, the poems show the deep connection between Jewish women and the Temple through the generations. For a discussion of the work see Yael Levine Katz, “ Tehinnat Ha’Nashim Le’Vinyan Ha’Mikdash ” in Margalit Shiloh, ed., Lehiyot Isha Yehudiya (Jerusalem: 2001) pp. 230-243, 344-348.

Devoting his studies at the Kuban State University in Krasnodar to Einstein’s theory of relativity and gravitation, Poltorak published several papers in this field and wrote his doctoral thesis on a solution to a long-standing ‘energy problem’ in the Theory of General Relativity. Accused of Jewish nationalist dissident activity, Poltorak was stripped of his academic degrees. In 1982 he immigrated to the USA. He served as an assistant professor of biomathematics at Cornell University Medical College, where he conducted research on mathematical modeling of blood-flow circulation in the brain and on Positron Emission Tomography. He also served as an assistant professor of physics at Touro College and adjunct professor of law at the Globe Institute of Technology. Poltorak is chairman and CEO of General Patent Corporation. He has coauthored two books and authored numerous papers on intellectual property law and economics. While still in Russia, Alex and his wife Leah became interested in religion as an outgrowth of their inquiry into science, and they became Torah-observant. Later, in Italy, on their way to America, Rabbi Hirsh Rabisky introduced them to Habad Hasidism. Dr. Poltorak has been active in Jewish education. He wrote many articles on Judaism for the Russian-Jewish press, cofounded and edited Yevreyski Mir , the first Russian Jewish weekly newspaper in the US, and hosted weekly radio programs on two Russian radio stations.

Together with Professor Herman Branover he organizes the International Conferences on Jews in a Changing World held in Riga. His paper, presented with Professor Branover at the 1997 Miami Torah and Science conference, “The Concept of Absolute Time in Science and Jewish Thought,” was published in B’Or Ha’Torah 11E (1999). Their joint 1999 Miami presentation, “The Observer and the System of Reference: A Unified View,” was published in B’Or Ha’Torah 13E (2002). ferber@latnet.lv Professor Herman Branover × Herman Branover was born in Riga, Latvia, earned his PhD from the Moscow Institute of Aviation in magnetohydrodynamics (MHD), and completed a DSc degree in physics and mathematics at the Leningrad Polytechnic Institute. While a leading scientist at the Latvian Academy of Science, Professor Branover discovered G-d and the Torah, became a Lubavitcher Hasid, and then struggled for the right for Jews to immigrate to Israel. During this difficult period and up until the present, he has led the cultural and spiritual revival of Russian Jewry. After settling in Beersheba with his wife and son, in 1977 Professor Branover created the Center for Magnetohydrodynamics Studies at Ben-Gurion University. The Center engages in teaching, research, and the development of a novel MHD electricity generator. He has authored over twenty scientific books and textbooks, thirty technological patents, hundreds of professional articles, and an autobiography, Return (published by Jason Aronson). As honorary president of SHAMIR, the Israel Association of Religious Professionals from the Former USSR, Professor Branover continues encouraging Russian Jews to observe the Torah and live in Israel.

Professor Miryam Z. Wahrman The ethical implications of turning humans into instruments—but at the same time the potential to use human clones to save other human lives—has led to a divergence of opinions among rabbinical scholars who have tackled the question of human cloning. While no clear consensus exists as to whether human cloning is “kosher,” Jewish scholars have analyzed the situation and have identified some major halakhic (Jewish legal) issues, of which this paper discusses the following points: Can human cloning be accepted on any level? Analysis of this question will include discussion of Torah sources as well as writings by modern experts in Jewish bioethics. Does cloning entail the creation of life? Does the production of clones usurp the role of the Creator? The concept of creation from nothing versus creation from something, and the relationship of cloning to the production of a golem will be discussed. What are the family relationships of a clone? Does cloning fulfill the biblical obligation to be “fruitful and multiply?”or does it violate G-d’s mandate to us? Genetic Screening, Genetic Therapy and Cloning in Judaism Professor Fred Rosner MD, FACP Genetic screening, gene therapy, and other applications of genetic engineering for the treatment, cure, or prevention of disease fulfills the bibilical mandate to heal. If Tay-Sachs disease, diabetes, hemophilia, cystic fibrosis, Huntington’s disease, or other genetic diseases can be cured or prevented by “gene surgery,” it is permitted in Jewish law. Genetic premarital screening is encouraged in Judaism for the purpose of discouraging at-risk marriages for a fatal illness such as Tay-Sachs disease. Neonatal screening for treatable conditions such as phenylketonuria is certainly desirable and perhaps required in Jewish law. Preimplantation screening and the use of only “healthy” zygotes for implantation into the mother’s womb to prevent the birth of an affected child is also probably sanctioned in Jewish law. Whether or not these assisted reproduction techniques can be used to choose the sex of one’s offspring to prevent the birth of a child with a sex-linked disease, such as hemophilia, has not yet been ruled out by modern rabbinic deciders. Prenatal screening with the specific intent of aborting an affected fetus is not allowed according to most rabbinic authorities, although a minority view permits it “for great need.” Not to have children if both parents are carriers of genetic diseases such as Tay-Sachs is not a Jewish option. Preimplantation screening is preferable. All screening test results must remain confidential. Cell and Organ Transplantation: The Torah Perspective Rabbi Professor Moshe D. Tendler New developments in transplantation medicine are of significant ethical import. Liver lobe transplant from live donors, an extension of the protocol for life-saving liver transplant from brainstem dead (BSD) patients, has become accepted therapy. Liver and heart transplants from non-beating donors (NHB) previously considered unsuitable for transplantation are becoming routine in response to the critical shortage of vital organs. The risk/burden evaluation must be done on a patient-by-patient basis rather than on general surgical principles. However, the checklist for all organ transplants remain the same: primacy of concern for donor safety in case of live donations; guarantee of fully informed voluntary consent; recognition that the recipient will suffer transplantation sickness and require life-long immunosuppression with its dangers of infection and neoplastic disease. Conservative management by dialysis or pharmacological modalities should be encouraged when feasible even if it restricts travel. By Torah ethics, organs should be assigned on the basis of the greatest likelihood of success, not to the sickest patient as is currently done. Although there is concern for increasing commodification of human organs and cells, remuneration for these life-saving therapies may be offered to increase the supply of donor cells and organs. Whereas direct payments should be forbidden, benefits in the form of tax credits or priority listing for organs should be given to consenting donors. Soul and Body—Judaism, Modern Medicine, and Cloning Professor Herman Branover Professor Tobiy Gurvich, MD, DSc The relationship between the soul and the body is one of the most fundamental philosophical problems in medicine. It is widely accepted in Judaism that a human being has two souls—‘divine’ and ‘animal’—closely related and interacting. Genesis 9:4 relates the animal soul with the blood; the Tanya relates the divine soul with the brain. A model schematically describing the relationships between the divine and animal souls and between soul and body is proposed in this study. The model is based on one hand on concepts propounded in the Zohar and on the other hand on conclusions reached by the great neurosurgeon Wilder Penfield. Penfield saw the “brain as computer, mind as programmer.” According to our model, if the brain is a computer, then both souls are programmers, and their permanent struggle for the dominant role in determining a person’s behavior is the manifestation of free will. This model may be proved by studying examples of monozygote twins, especially, conjoined twins. Monozygote twins share an identical physical and genetic constitution, but have different personalities and moral qualities. If human cloning could be accomplished, genetically the clone would have the status of a monozygote twin in respect to the person who provided the cell nucleus for the cloning. But what would his or her spiritual identity be? Artificial Insemination and Surrogate Motherhood  through the Prism of Jewish Law Rabbi Kenneth Brander Scientific breakthroughs are giving hope to many who once only dreamed of having a family, while simultaneously creating a host of dilemmas for halakha (Jewish law) to decide. The particular focus of our discussion will be the establishment of parenthood in two particular contexts. What establishes a male as the father of a child? Is it the act of sexual intercourse, which in many modalities is nonexistent, or the contribution of the sperm that fertilizes the egg? What if a male’s sperm fertilizes the egg only after the man has passed on? Does Judaism consider the deceased donor to be the father? A more complicated matter is the issue of maternal status. This issue arises, in particular, with a surrogate mother where the egg donor and the host are different women. Who is the mother of the child? The woman who genetically contributes or the one who nurtures the embryo through the gestational period? This affects various issues, not limited to, the definition of the child's family, issues of Jewish identity, and the identification of prohibited incestuous relationships. Cloning Revisited: Blessing or Curse? Daniel Kantor Professor Jeffrey Kantor Jonathan Kantor In recent years the debate concerning the cloning of mammalian life has generally turned from a debate whether cloning is ethical, to one of when is cloning not ethical. This paper, reassessing the question of cloning from both a Jewish ethics and a general Western ethics perspective, was prompted by recent conflicting reports of genetic defects found in Dolly, the cloned sheep. Traditional arguments against cloning, such as the loss of individuality and uniqueness, and the dangers of taking creation into our own hands, are juxtaposed against an alternative version of the golem legend and the potential use of cloning in studies of brain structure and development. We recommend a functional approach to cloning, and a shift of the cloning debate from when is cloning not ethical to when is cloning necessary. Finally, the lessons learned from cloning are applied to the future debate concerning the permissibility of turning off biological computers. Jewish Medical Ethics on the Threshold of a New Century: Trends and Challenges Professor Emeritus Velvl Greene Although the term Jewish Medical Ethics first came into use in the 1950s, and the popular interest is a recent phenomenon, their relevance and acceptance has been part of the fabric of the Jewish people since Sinai. Rabbinical rulings dealing with health and medicine, based on the commandments in the Pentateuch and their elaboration in the Talmud and codes of Jewish law, have come down to us over the centuries, and new ones are issued every year. The collection of such rabbinical rulings is know as halakha—the right path. Halakha is a dynamic and ongoing process covering all aspects of life. It is not derived by philosophic speculation about contrived situations. This is why most Jewish medical ethicists emphasize the doctor-patient relationship; most of the questions presented for adjudication belong to this category. They were posed by doctors or patients or their families. In the future, it is expected that more questions will be submitted in non-medical areas that have a profound impact on health and medical treatment. Halakha will have to come to grips with a shrinking world and its sociological overtones: how Jewish doctors (and a Jewish state) deal with communities that have different values from ours about life and death, who practice idolatry, non-Western medicine, and what we might consider cruelty—the whole field of cross-cultural ethics. But the much more serious problem will be the very status of medical halakha in a Jewish community, the majority of which are apathetic to (and even antagonistic to) halakha. Using Jewish Medical Ethics to Appreciate the Relative among the Absolute Professor Louis Flancbaum, MD Contemporary Jewry faces many challenges, including how to reduce rampant assimilation and intermarriage, how to best educate Jewish youth, and how to foster Jewish continuity and identification with the State of Israel. Yet, many believe that the most serious problem confronting world Jewry is internal strife. This is most dramatically illustrated by interdenominational conflicts over such issues as personal status and the role of women in religious practice. Unfortunately, discussion of these issues has been punctuated by excessively negative rhetoric from all sides. Numerous attempts have been made to (re)establish civil dialogue between the leaders and adherents of the different branches within Judaism. Among the most successful interactions have been those that revolve around Torah study—utilizing textual analysis to emphasize common heritage and history, creating an environment conducive to fruitful discussion of Jewish concepts. One such discipline that has successfully served as a vehicle to bridge this divide is biomedical ethics. Study and analysis of areas of interest in bioethics, such as birth control, abortion, smoking, the definition of death as it pertains to organ transplantation, and treatment of the terminally ill can enhance communication and understanding among Jews. Each of these topics can be studied from the perspective of Orthodox, Conservative, and Reform Judaism, using responsa from rabbinic authorities of each denomination, and broad areas of interdenominational agreement concerning the resolution of these ethical dilemmas can be demonstrated. Hopefully, such consensus building will highlight the potential for study of other relevant ethical topics in order to bring Jews closer together. The Impact of Religion and Spirituality on Human Health Jonathan Braunstein, MD Illness is a spiritual event, raising troubling questions of a transcendental nature about the meaning of life, the values in life that are most important, and the kinds of activities and relationships that should take precedence. Research suggests that clinical decision making in medical practice should consider the strength and prevalence of religious beliefs and practices among patients. Patients want physicians to take their religious commitment into account in planning their treatment. Cardio-Energetics and the Kabbala Rabbi Arthur Seltzer, PhD Through the theory and observation of cardio-energetics, and through the technology of heart transplantation, we witness the emergence of a new way of looking at the heart and its energy. This new view is based on quantum perspectives of energy and the multiple levels through which the heart can be perceived and experienced. In effect, the study of cardio-energetics provides us with new and clearer insights into the teachings of the Kabbala and Hasidism concerning the heart and its ability to elevate the universe through the transformation of our own hearts. Both cardio-energetics and our sages understand—despite differences in time, context, language, and intent—that we establish essential harmony within ourselves through the heart. This harmony reflects the harmonies of above and below inherent within the Creation. Spiritual Modality for Behavior Modification Rabbi Sholom D. Lipskar According to Jewish tradition, every human being has an animal soul related to the blood and a divine soul related to the mind. These two souls struggle for control of the entire personality. The natural method to change behavior is for thought to affect emotion, which affects action. The Torah method of behavior modification reverses this hierarchy: The action of performing Torah commandments affects emotion, which affects thought. Performing Torah commandments allows the animal soul to fully function but subordinates it to the divine soul. Proof of the effectiveness of this system is the meaningful continuity of the Jewish people. This system has been applied with great remedial success to Jewish prisoners and their families by the Aleph Institute in Miami. God and Morality Professor Yitzchok (Irving) Block Without G-d there is no valid justification for a morality of any kind, new or old. The pivotal point of this argument is to notice that what distinguishes moral judgments and makes them unique is that they are categorical. What is meant by 'categorical' here is basically what Immanuel Kant meant when he said that moral judgments are binding on all human beings no matter what kind of society they live in. Many people are inclined to say that the only thing that can justify the categorical element of moral judgments is the fact that G-d commanded them. However, being commanded by G-d is not a necessary and sufficient condition for something being a categorical, moral judgment. What then is the justification of a moral judgment? This is a difficult question to answer, but I believe it is connected with the idea that we were made in the image of G-d, and therefore contain innate elements of natural goodness which is part and parcel of the soul and life of every human being, and is expressed in the two basic moral senses of justice and compassion. Science and Religion: The Range of Engagement Professor James E. Huchingson Science and religion are popularly known for their tempestuous relationship. But this simplistic and distorted characterization misses the complex ways in which these two major authorities actually interact. This range of engagement includes conflict as well as claims of mutual independence and efforts at dialogue. However they choose to interact, the question of Divine action in the world is crucial for both parties. Science adamantly opposes interference in the orderly patterns of nature, and yet with equal conviction theology insists on G-d's providential involvement in the Creation. How is the discussion of science with religion offering constructive insights into this divisive issue? The answers reveal insights into both the progress and the frustrations involved in the contemporary engagement. Torah Study, Prayer and Health: A Proposal to Examine the Impact of Torah Study and Prayer on the Health of Older Adults Pamela Elfenbein, PhD, MSW An obvious by-product of the ever-increasing range of life expectancy is the myriad of problems that range from chemical and medical debilitation to emotional and mental problems, such as depression, loneliness, anxiety, and fear among the elderly. The lack of purpose and meaning and a feeling of uselessness is a major problem of this demographic segment. While rigorous scientific research has clearly identified salutary effects of religion on health, and well-thought-out hypotheses describe the mechanisms believed to impart these effects, a tremendous chasm remains—the gap between empirical findings and post hoc explanations. Using an experimental design, we are proposing research based on informal programs and studies initiated by the Lubavitcher Rebbe, under the aegis “School for the Elderly,” that successfully overcome much of the aforementioned dysfunction. Through reacclimation to languages and lifestyles of their youth, the inner spirituality of elderly Jews surfaces. Men=Women?Men:  Difference Deniers and Difference Celebrators Shira Leibowitz Schmidt In the current debate raging in academic literature on the differences between men and women, at one end are ‘essentialists’ who maintain that destiny is determined completely by biology. At the other end are ‘difference deniers’ who maintain that though there are a few physical differences between men and women, destiny is determined completely by cultural conditioning, and differences can be leveled out almost completely. Normative Judaism resolves this dialectic by incorporating these seemingly mutually exclusive views. The Torah expounds an axiom of dissimilar equality of the two genders. On the level of Creation, women and men have equal moral potential and responsibility. On the level of halakha (Jewish law), women do not have the same obligations as men do. The moral quality of a person’s life is more important than his or her biological functioning.

Creation: The Argument from Finitude Professor Yitzchok (Irving) Block The creation of a finite world by an absolutely infinite God is a contradiction. Nonetheless, it is rational to suppose that God is absolutely infinite, and it is undeniable that finite things exist. How can one reconcile these two apparently inconsistent facts? The answer is Creation, as this is expounded in the Lurianic notion of tsimtsum (contraction). Even though Creation itself transcends human understanding, Creation is, nonetheless, the only way of giving some semblance of understanding as to how a finite world came to exist. The Concept of Absolute Time in Science and Jewish Thought Professor Herman Branover Professor Ruvin Ferber This paper was originally presented at the Second International Conference on Jews in a Changing World, held in Riga, Latvia on August 25-27, 1997. The only one of its kind where Eastern European Jews discuss their past, present, and future ethical, cultural, social, and intellectual challenges, the conference was sponsored by the Memorial Foundation for Jewish Culture of New York and the Soros Foundation of Latvia. Chief Rabbi of Riga and Latvia, Natan Barkan, was its Honorary President. Professors Herman Branover and Ruvin Ferber co-chaired the conference and co-edited its Proceedings, published by SHAMIR in English and Russian. Both contemporary physics and traditional Jewish thought recognize two types of time: 1) absolute or unified world time; 2) relative or local time. Using Moshe Carmeli’s equations, cosmological time is read backwards, approaching the initial moment of Creation. The closer we mentally approach the point of temporal origin, however, the longer the time intervals become. Insight into Louis de Broglie’s Great Law of Nature reveals that a perfectly free elementary particle must be, in essence, itself a perfect or ideal clock. This insight may provide a missing link between the geometric concept of the space-time continuum and the arithmetic concept of time. Maimonides disagrees with the midrash that time had existed before the Creation. Hasidic philosophy also upholds that time was created with the rest of the universe by G-d. Hasidism defines two types of time: 1) ‘absolute, permanently flowing’ (etsem hemshekh ha’zman); 2) ‘measurable and estimable (zman ha’nimdad veha’meshuar). There is a special cycle in the Hasidic system called ratso v’shov, which comprises a dual process of ‘escape and return.’ In physics this corresponds with the periodically recurrent process needed to measure time, i.e. with a finite ‘to-and-fro’ cycle which occurs by means of some restoring force. Time and the Age of Our Universe Professor Gerald Schroeder Science looks back in time and observes an evolution of our universe that took some 10 to 20 billion years from the Big Bang. The Genesis Creation chapter of the Torah looks forward in time from the formation of stable matter and describes the same events as having lasted six days. To understand the Genesis view of time in terms of our current perspective, we must expand the six Genesis days by 1012 to accommodate the expansion of the universe since the moment of matter formation, as standardly interpreted by the redshift. The six days of Genesis become 6 million days in our view. When converted to years, this equals 16.4 billion years. Nahmanides’ commentary on Genesis remarkably presages the description of the unfolding of matter and time given by the current Big Bang theory for the age of the universe. Man as the Pinnacle of Creation Professor Nathan Aviezer Recent advances in astronomy support the Torah view that the entire universe exists solely for the benefit of human life. It is now recognized that all the chemical elements (except hydrogen) necessary for life were originally formed deep in the interior of the stars. These elements were later ejected into space whenever a star underwent a violent supernova explosion. Eventually, the chemicals reached our solar system to form the living tissue of plants, animals, and humans. Furthermore, the vast distances that separate the stars from us are crucial to our existence. Stellar explosions emit not only the chemical elements that are essential for life; they also emit deadly cosmic radiation. These scientific findings are consistent with a grand design for Creation. Ten Dimensions: A Physical Theory of Everything Rabbi Naftali Berg, PhD By studying and understanding the attempts by physicists to unify all the forces of nature and all the matter of the universe into one theory, we can better understand how the multiplicity of created entities and creatures spring from a basic unity. Part One: Introduction The Hasidic Search for Unity The Scientific Search for the Unity of Nature Part Two: Scientific Background The Four Forces Force Equals Geometry A Four Dimensional Force Physics in a Higher Dimension Part Three: The New Physics Quantized Forces The Particle Zoo Symmetry and Forces Einsteinian Beauty Superstring Theory Anthropic Principle The Future Part Four: Conclusion This innovative paper is an edited transcript of a lecture delivered at the Rabbi Aryeh Leib Seminar a few months before Naftali Berg’s untimely death in 1994. Naftali willed that the lecture be published with its science content expanded by his U.S. Army Research Laboratory colleague, Dr. Bruce Weber. We are grateful to Dr. Weber and the members of the B’Or Ha’Torah Advisory Board for their careful and faithful work. Inside Time Based on Talks by the Lubavitcher Rebbe, Rabbi M. M. Schneerson, Rendered by Rabbi Yanki Tauber Shabbat is a venture into timelessness—a realm that lies beyond the struggle of our weekday lives. After each Shabbat we return to a time-bound existence. Time, in the sense of motion and flux, begins anew. The entirety of history is also a ‘week,’ comprised of six ‘workday’ millenia and a seventh millenium of rest. During the workweek we are challenged by evil and negativity, so progress inevitably involves struggle. On Shabbat however, and to an even greater extent, in the messianaic era, progress is an inward journey, a settling into our true ‘place’ and identity. The Shabbat Notepad Ephraim Nissan, PhD What happens when unpursued intellectual illumination strikes us during Shabbat or Yom Tov? Using a Shabbat Notepad, we can temporarily store a few key words of the idea by putting numbered markers into pigeonholes labeled with letters and other characters. This frees us to enjoy the rest of Shabbat. After Shabbat, we can reconstruct the memo and develop the idea further. Reaching the Moon: The Lubavitcher Rebbe on Outer Space Rabbi Yitshak Yehuda Rozen The Talmud presented the possibility of flying to outer space as an example of an impossible feat. After the first astronaut landed on the moon, the Lubavitcher Rebbe was asked how this affected halakha (Jewish law). Questions of faith were also raised. The codifiers of halakha have always taken an empirical attitude toward science, basing decisions on the facts available to them and avoiding theory. Continuing this approach, the Lubavitcher Rebbe found nothing objectionable in space flight. Space travel became a popular metaphor for him to teach increased service of God. Life on Mars? Professor Nathan Aviezer A meteorite found in Antarctica riveted world attention when the US Space Agency announced on 7 August 1996 that the rock had originated from Mars and showed marks left by bacteria. The news was dramatic enough to move the American government to reverse the budget slashes it had made on its space exploration program. Researchers at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, however, subsequently demonstrated that purely inorganic happenings can produce identical marks. The claim of “life on Mars” has been quietly dropped. Torah Metaphysics versus Newtonian Empiricism Rabbi Shimon Dovid Cowen, PhD From the Hasidic point of view, Newton’s theories of gravity and inertia are not compatible with the Torah because they are entirely focused on the material and empirical. The cosmology of Hasidism, which draws from the metaphysics of Maimonides and the Kabbala, maintains that the entire created universe—both spiritual and material—is constantly enlivened by God. It is the differentiated process of enlivening of the seder hishtalshalut (order of creation) which keeps the planets and stars and sun in motion and reaches the stationary Earth as its center. Why Wasn’t Newton Born in China? Professor Avraham Kushelevsky Although China had reached a high level of technology while Europe was still barbarian, theoretical physics developed not in China but in Europe after it was influenced by monotheism. Both monotheism and modern science strive to find the unity of the universe. Professor Kushelevsky delivered this paper originally as “The Rise of Science in the West—Or Why Wasn’t Einstein Born in Japan?” for the Yisrael Hatsair- B’Or Ha’Torah lecture series on September 22, 1993. The author changed the title when he wrote the following summary of his lecture. The inspiration for the original title came from an advertising campaign in Israel for a brand of Japanese electronics dubbed “the Einstein of Japan.” The Appendix at the end of this article on the religious works of Sir Isaac Newton was guided by Professor Kushelevsky. Solomon Maimon: A Second Look at the Enlightenment Yoseph Udelson, PhD An unkempt but brilliant vagabond and gadfly, Solomon Maimon (c.1753-1800) shambled his way from the ravished Jewish villages in Polish Lithuania to the most fashionable salons of Berlin. Child talmudic prodigy; lifelong antagonist of the Jewish establishment; guest at the court of the leader of the Hasidic movement, the Maggid of Mezeritch; and iconoclastic innovator in secular philosophy, Maimon experienced personally and recorded many of the turbulent currents of modern Jewish and European history that began to stir in the eighteenth century. Joy and Sorrow”  from Wendy Dickstein’s novelization of The Life of Gluckel of Hameln) Wendy Dickstein Gluckel of Hameln lived in Germany in the seventeenth century. Her memoirs in early Yiddish give a rare firsthand glimpse of Jewish life during that period and are considered the first book written by a Jewish woman. Torah Code Abuse  a review of The Bible Code by Michael Drosnin Professor Avraham M. Hasofer When Professor Hasofer stated in his rejoinder in B’Or Ha’Torah 8E (1993) that codes could be found in any text long enough, many did not believe him. Now, through the use of computers, it has been possible to find codes with a high “statistical” significance in practically every text with enough letters. Now, also, Christians have found codes in Scripture supporting their doctrine, and Michael Drosnin has bewildered the world with his best-selling book The Bible Code . Why should anyone need to support the Torah by mathematical and statistical arguments? Why should outreaching Jews try to convince disbelievers of the Divine origin of the Torah via a method opposed to the values of the Torah itself? Torah and the Literary Imagination Professor Dan Vogel Cynthia Ozick, the renowned American-Jewish writer, once expressed the fear that the “magical” creation of literary images may “offend” the Second Commandment because the writer tends to worship the process. While Ozick expresses concern for the writer, this article explores the implications of her notion, both for writer and reader. Three aspects of the attitude of Torah Judaism to the operations of the literary imagination are discussed: first, rabbinic texts that seem to place verbal images in the purview of the Second Commandment, thus substantiating in part Ozick’s fears; second, rabbinic statements that give the literary imagination a mission and a responsibility; and third, insistence that every reader become an active critic and evaluator of what he/she reads. Thus the literary imagination, rather than offending the Second Commandment, can have an honorable and useful place in Torah Judaism. Women’s Rights in the Torah: The Daughters of Tslofhad Susan Schneider The Torah account of how the daughters of Tslofhad presented their case to Moses to receive their father’s land as inheritance serves as an excellent role model for Jewish women today who long to study and participate in communal life. The Meaning of Tekhelet Baruch Sterman PhD Tekhelet , the ancient biblical blue dye which adorned the robes of kings, priests, and simple Jews, was lost to the world nearly 1300 years ago. Recent advances in the fields of archeology, marine biology and chemistry in conjunction with intense examination of historical and talmudic sources have identified the source of the dye as the snail Murex trunculus. The mitsva (Commandment) to wear a thread of tekhelet is once again being fulfilled by Jews. This article recounts the rediscovery of tekhelet and examines the meaning of the mitsva of tekhelet in tsitsit (ritual fringes), its purpose and significance, according to various commentators and scholars.

Global Ecology: On the Road to Redemption Aryeh Gotfryd, PhD The ecological concept \"think global, act local\" corresponds to Maimonides' description that every deed of every individual tips the scales both of his life and of the entire world. Towards Environmental Consciousness—The Need to Educate Professor Herman Branover The technical means exist to solve every ecological problem in the world. The technological solutions are not implemented, however, because of deeply ingrained negative economic, political, and psychological attitudes. We need to educate our young to restore and protect our ravaged ecosystem. To do this, our school systems must be overhauled to truly educate in environmental consciousness. The values and dynamics of successful religious education can help us design and carry out this urgent task, which should be number one on the international agenda. This paper was originally presented as Professor Branover's honorary doctorate lecture to the Presidia of the Russian Academy of Science in Moscow in 1993. It was published in Volume 3 of the 1994-1995 issue of Perspectives in Energy and has been revised by the author for B'Or Ha'Torah . Jewish Environmental Law: A Selected Bibliography Ilana and Yehuda Attia This is a selected list of sources of classical Jewish legislation on environmental appreciation, preservation, and regulation. Not all of the following precepts were legislated solely for environmental reasons. Often, ecological or aesthetic measures were prescribed to achieve a necessary level of social order or sanctity. God, Man, and Tree Rabbi Aryeh Strikovsky, PhD The Torah command not to destroy fruit trees when besieging a city was expanded by our sages into a prohibition against any needless destruction of nature. The metaphor of the tree has been used by Jewish mystics throughout the ages to represent the connection between God and man in both song and deed. The love of Jews for nature was ruptured by 2000 years of harsh exile. Now that we have returned to our land, we should reactivate our legacy of environmental protection and share it with the world. The Problem of Ecology:  Living at the Expense of Future Generations Professor Yehudah Levi The Torah entrusts us to manage the world. Its command \"do not destroy\" applies to all of God's property, including the human body. The Commandments regulate city planning and the urban and rural populations. Talmudic injunctions prevent urban residents from causing physical or psychological damage to their neighbors and from polluting their cities. Only Torah observance can reshape human nature and limit the selfishness which is the major cause of environmental destruction today. Healing Bitter Water and Water as an Agent in Healing Eyal Goldberger, MD, MFHom There are two instances in Scripture of healing bitter water: in Exodus 15 by Moses, and in II Kings 2 by Elisha. These two cases can be used as a model approach to healing in general. The principle of cure in both examples is based on using an agent which causes symptoms similar to the disease itself. This principle of healing \"like with like\" is applied by homeopathic medicine. Moreover, the structure and properties of water are very important to homeopathy. Homeopathic medicines are prepared by repeated series of dilutions and 'succusions' in water. The Tsemah Tsedek discourses on the same special properties of water discussed here. The Biblical History of Rainfall and Irrigation Rabbi Aryeh Strikovsky, PhD In the Torah account of Genesis, the Garden of Eden was plentifully irrigated by a river that branched out in four directions. After Adam and Eve were expelled from Eden, the soil was cursed and rain became dependent on human conduct. After the Flood, God established fixed laws of nature to control the rainfall of the entire Earth except for the Land of Israel, where rainfall was dependent upon the conduct of her people. In the prophecies of Zekharya, Ezekiel, Joel, and the Psalms, a miraculous spring will emerge from the Temple in the time of the redemption. This spring will purify the polluted soil and bring life to the Dead Sea. It will irrigate abundant vegetation yielding fruits that heal. According to these prophets, the rainfall and irrigation of Israel will be restored to the blessed conditions of Eden. The Fluidity of Life: From the Notebooks of Rabbi Menahem Mendel Schneerson Rendered by Rabbi Yanki Tauber Throughout the writings of the Lubavitcher Rebbe, Rabbi Menahem Mendel Schneerson, there are occasional references to his \"journal\" or \"notebooks\" (reshimot). Three such notebooks were discovered in a drawer in the Rebbe's desk about a month after his passing on Tammuz 3, 5754 (June 12, 1994). The entries in these journals are dated from 1928 (the year of the Rebbe's marriage) until 1950 (the year his father-in-law, the previous Rebbe, passed away). Throughout these years — which included his evacuation from Berlin in 1933, his escape from Nazi-occupied Paris in 1941, and his subsequent flight through Vichy France and fascist Spain — the Rebbe continued jotting down the scholarly and sublime products of his mind in even the most precarious of circumstances. Of historical and scholastic value in their own right, these notebooks also give us new insight into the entire body of the Rebbe's teachings. They contain the seeds of concepts that the Rebbe developed in his talks, essays, and letters during the four decades of his leadership. The following essay, adapted from an undated entry exploring the moral and spiritual significance of Pascal's Law of Hydrostatics, is a case in point. While, to the author's knowledge, this particular thesis does not appear anywhere else in the Rebbe's voluminous work, it touches upon several key concepts of the Rebbe's teachings, such as the importance for every person to translate his most refined talents and experiences into action, and the potential of every phenomenon to serve as a lesson in life. As the Rebbe wrote these notes for himself, we can, at best, offer only an educated guess as to the meaning buried in the shorthand of phrases and references comprising much of these writings. A shorter version of this essay appeared in Week in Review Vol. VII, No. 12 (The Hanachot Foundation, 788 Eastern Parkway, Suite 303, Brooklyn, NY 11213-3409). The Apple Revealed: From a Jewish and Nutritional Perspective Yaakov Levinson Jewish tradition attributes healing qualities to the apple. Although today the apple is low in nutritional value, it is rich in antioxidants helpful in preventing heart disease and cancer. In the End of Days, the apple — along with all other trees — will be restored to the complete strength it enjoyed in the Garden of Eden. The Jewish Academy Rabbi Yitzchak Ginsburgh It is possible to understand how the Torah addresses the arts and sciences by creating a conceptual model based upon the constellation of forces (referred to in Kabbala as sfirot) that define the internal structure of reality established with Creation. Each sfira can be associated with a specific discipline of the arts and sciences. Torah and Science: From Elokim to Havaya, Part Two Professor Eliezer Zeiger In Part One of this paper in BHT 9E we established that the two most commonly used names of God, Havaya and Elokim, explain the interplay between God's unity and infinity. Whereas Havaya represents Divine absolute, undifferentiated unity, Elokim refers to the infinite Divine power of creation expressed in the vast mineral, plant, animal, and human diversity of nature. In our human reality, where absolute truth is hidden from us, we have ascending levels of trying to approach truth: from common sense, to science, to Torah. Among the sciences themselves there is a scale from diversity to unity in understanding nature. Biological science describes the diversity and differentiation of nature, while physics and mathematics strive to amalgamate a unified theory of the universe. The most direct way toward God, though, is not through truth but loving-kindness. Justice in the Marketplace Peter Kalms The following article based on Dr. Meir Tamari's book The Challenge of Wealth was presented at the First International Conference \"Jews in a Changing World\" held in Riga, Latvia, in August 1995. This conference discussed challenges facing Jews in the CIS and the Baltic States and throughout the world. The Prime Minister of Latvia, with many of his ministers, and members of Parliament, university presidents, and leading Jewish and Gentile academics attended and spoke on the Jewish contribution to world culture and science and the problems threatening Jewish continuity. Organized by Rabbi Natan Barkan, Chief Rabbi of Riga and Latvia and the SHAMIR representative to Latvia, the conference generated unprecedented interest among Russian Jews and the Russian news media. A second conference is being planned for 1997. Jewish Bankruptcy Law as a Vehicle for Societal Kindness Russell Jay Hendel, PhD How does Jewish law govern the division of insufficient assets among the creditors of the deceased? Unlike the traditional secular method of paying each creditor an amount proportional to what is due him, Jewish bankruptcy law has the smallest debt paid off first by paying the amount of the smallest debt to each of the lenders. If money remains after that, then the next smallest amount is paid off. This process is continued until the estate is exhausted. Although this method seems contrary to common sense, it is used today as a practical solution to other types of allotment problems. Besides defending its rationality, this article will show that the Jewish system makes society more personal and charitable, consistent with the tradition and vision of loving-kindness combined with justice passed down to us by our forefather Abraham. Mezuza – The Arrow in Life Alexander Poltorak, PhD The mezuza combines the holiness of all three dimensions. It is affixed in space to the doorpost, the threshold of the house. As the threshold marks the transition from one domain to another, the mezuza symbolizes motion. Zuz, the root of the word mezuza, means \"to move.\" Motion is the essence of time. The words shana (year) and shniya (second) come from the word shinui (change). All these words denote change or motion. Hence, the mezuza marks holiness in time. Towards an Authentic Judaica:  A Design Strategy for Ritual Objects Janet Berg Winner of the first Philip and Sylvia Spertus Judaica Prize for Jewish Ceremonial Art (the largest Jewish art award in the world) in 1994, Janet Berg's Hanukkiya Hinukhit is the inaugural piece of a projected collection of Jewish ceremonial objects structurally and functionally expressing laws and concepts related to the commandments they enable us to perform. Together in Separateness:  Understanding Taharat Ha'Mishpaha Rabbi Reuven P. Bulka, PhD Though the major onus of the laws of taharat ha'mishpaha (Jewish family purity) rests on the woman, following these laws enhances and uplifts the entire family. The untranslatable concepts of tahara and tuma are the key to understanding ritual separateness and reunion. When one is tameh, one is in a state of limbo, not yet ready to assume or resume certain interactional relations. This is a contemplative time to focus on the inner causes and implications of the tameh condition. Invariably, the state of being tameh arises from the loss of life potential, as in the case of menstruation, or from being in direct or indirect contact with death. The law serves to inculcate respect for the wife, for her dignity as a person, for her being entrusted with control of the rhythm of family life. Blood, Wine, and Childbirth:  A Commentary on Leviticus Chapter 12 Miriam Schwarz Why does the Torah classify the postpartum woman as tmaea  (roughly translated as \"impure\")? Why is she commanded to bring a sin-offering to the Temple? A study of the definition of the concepts of blood and tuma and of the traditional Jewish connection between childbirth and atonement give us part of the answer. The scriptural association between blood and wine and an insight by the contemporary scholar Nehama Leibowitz further help to develop our understanding. Parental Attitude and Child Development Marilyn Tokayer Post-industrial Western culture gave rise to a restrained approach to parenting. Today, however, new research on the mother-child relationship is revealing the need for more responsive parenting. The new research converges with the traditional Jewish approach. Mothers are created with a built-in radar system that can be tuned more finely than we think. Constant contact with the mother teaches the infant trust, empathy, and love and (contrary to popular Western belief) helps the child become secure and independent. Comments on Tokayer's Paper Marilyn Tokayer's paper, \"Parental Attitude and Child Development,\" is a welcome plea for responsible parenting, precisely because such pleas are not enunciated often enough today. However, it contains statements that deserve further comment. Response to Rabbi Bulka's Comments Marilyn Tokayer Rabbi Bulka's interpretation of my passage on \"marsupial mothering\" is quite dramatic in itself. My intention was to point out the positive effects of not keeping babies in their cribs gazing at mobiles. These include passive participation in the bearer's activities, the opportunity to experience language, pace, sights, and sounds. \"Marsupial babies\" enjoy continued development of the balance systems in the inner ear (the vestibular system). In my research I found that these babies develop faster than those in our Western culture. They are superior in discerning object permanence, language development, and social responsiveness, and they show enhanced visual alertness. After taking note of all this information, I find it difficult to believe that God did not intend for caretakers to keep their infants in their arms. Mobiles are made by man in a culture which warns against spoiling babies by carrying them around too much. Arms were created by God and so was the need for babies to be held. Mobiles are cute but should not be used to replace close human contact. The Yeshiva as a Place of Secular Learning Professor Alvin Radkowsky The following speech, calling for scholars of the secular universities and the yeshiva academies to share their knowledge, was delivered at the 1990 Alumni Dinner of Yeshiva University. The concept of complementarity is the key to this sharing. Complementarity also explains the paradox between free will and God's foreknowledge: They are complementary aspects of a single entity and do not conflict, since they can never be observed simultaneously. Perceptions of the Shamir in Three Dimensions:  Midrash, History, and Theory Professor Pesach (Paul) Goldstein Although by definition miracles do not have to be explained as scientifically observable phenomena, the miraculous shamir which cut the stones for King Solomon's Temple matches the description of alpha radiation.

His parents came there from Poland, after surviving the Holocaust. After graduating high school with honors, he earned an HonBSc in Zoology and a PhD in Ecology at the University of Toronto. In the course of his graduate research on the ecology of birds in urban woodlots, he was awarded Ontario Graduate and Canadian Wildlife Scholarships. Interested in the effects of observer bias on empirical data, scientific conclusions and environmental management decisions, he has written or co-authored three books and nine journal articles on topics ranging from urban ecology, songbird habitat selection, reliability analyses of statistical inferences, and environmental management. He currently directs the Gotfryd Group of landscape architects and environmental scientists in North York. Calling himself a \"late starter in Judaism,\" Dr. Gotfryd, with his wife and children, is active in the Habad community of Toronto. Believing that an awareness of the Creator should permeate all of one's activities, he doubles as a troubadour, singing Jewish \"soul music\" at schools, hospitals, and other places. \"On Acknowledging the Creator in Scientific Literature\" by Dr. Gotfryd appeared in BHT 6E. Professor Herman Branover × Herman Branover was born in Riga, Latvia, earned his PhD from the Moscow Institute of Aviation in magnetohydrodynamics (MHD), and completed a DSc degree in physics and mathematics at the Leningrad Polytechnic Institute. While a leading scientist at the Latvian Academy of Science, Professor Branover discovered G-d and the Torah, became a Lubavitcher Hasid, and then struggled for the right for Jews to immigrate to Israel. During this difficult period and up until the present, he has led the cultural and spiritual revival of Russian Jewry.

After making aliya to Israel and studying for several years in yeshivot in Jerusalem, he married and moved to Kfar Habad, where he lives with his family. Rabbi Ginsburgh is Rosh Yeshiva of Od Yosef Hai, near Joseph's tomb in Shkhem. He also teaches Hasidism in Israel and the diaspora and is the Rosh Kollel of Kollel Menuha Rahel in Hebron. Rabbi Ginsburgh's teachings on Hasidism are published in English and Hebrew by Gal Einai in Jerusalem. His system is based on the interrelation and flow among the five fundamental Torah-oriented topics of art and music, mathematics/natural sciences, psychology of mind (\"light shining to oneself\" — the service of meditation), psychology of heart (\"light shining to others\" — the rectification of character), and sociology/government. Professor Avraham Kushelevsky × At age nine, Avraham Kushelevsky emigrated with his family from the United States to Israel, where his father, Rabbi Eliyahu Kushelevsky, became the head of the rabbinical court of Beersheba. After studying at the Slobodka Yeshiva in Bnei Brak and the Hebron Yeshiva in Jerusalem, Kushelevsky went to England to study physics and received his doctorate from Salford University. Returning to Israel, he taught and conducted research in Medical Physics at the Ben-Gurion University of the Negev in Beersheba. He chaired the Technological Incubator in Ofakim and represented the Ministry of Environment in the Interministerial Committee on Ionizing Radiation. Three articles by Professor Kushelevsky—“The Religious Foundations of Science,” “The War between Religion and Science in the Nineteenth Century and the Change in the Twentieth Century,” and “Halacha and the Preservation of the Text of the Holy Scriptures”—were translated into English from the Hebrew in B’Or Ha’Torah issues 1 and 2 and published in B’Or Ha’Torah 7E. They were reprinted in the anthology edited by Herman Branover and Ilana Attia, Science in the Light of the Torah , published by Jason Aronson in 1994. Professor Kushelevsky was an active member of the B’Or Ha’Torah International Advisory Board. His guidelines were always clear; his criticism constructive; his attitude modest, cheerful, and optimistic. His untimely death over a year ago deprived us of a great friend and a true man of Torah and science.

Perot Ha-Ilan Scholarship Fund Home Page Special Programs Ethiopian Program ... Perot Ha-Ilan This fund is named the Perot Ha-Ilan Scholarship Fund after Major Ilan Meir Raiz z\"l. The fund's aim is to encourage and help develop religious young men with advanced technological training who will join the army. The idea of the fund is really a reflection of my late husband's personality.  Ilan was a career officer in the IDF, who used his technological academic background to the full whilst serving in relevant positions in various units, including combat units.  Ilan died suddenly from a cardiac arrest before he turned 36. At the Jerusalem College of Technology where the fund is held, there is an excellent project designed to train young religious Ethiopian engineers as academic officers in the IDF.  The fund aspires to grant as many scholarships as it possibly can to the young people involved in the project, thus promoting this specific sector in the Israeli population, by investing in technological education for the young generation. At the JCT we believe it is our responsibility and challenge to enable diverse segments of Israeli society, especially those whose families have had no previous exposure to higher education and who otherwise would not have the opportunity to pursue academic studies, to become productive members of Israel's work force. One of these groups that we are empowering to take their place in the high-tech world, are members of the Ethiopian community in Israel. Today, over 100,000 Ethiopian Jews live in Israel.  The integration of Ethiopian Jews posed and continues to pose a tremendous challenge to Israeli society to integrate. Ethiopian Jews come from a predominantly agricultural society where many were never exposed to modern technology and few of the immigrants arrived with marketable skills.  The number of 12th graders from the Ethiopian community achieving high school matriculation is the lowest percentage of any group in Israel. Juvenile delinquency and unemployment are rampant and only a small percentage of Ethiopian immigrants have gone on for higher education in Israel. According to the Israel Association for Ethiopian Jews, “The most critical obstacle to the absorption of the Ethiopian community is the education system.  For the Ethiopian community, education is the only avenue to social mobility and a critical key to the future”.

About Lustig- Academic Programs for Haredi Women The campus offers academic degree programs in Software Engineering, Computer Science, Business Administration, Accounting and Information Systems as well as teaching certifications in Managerial Accounting and Computer Science.  Since its establishment, Lustig has awarded over 1,000 academic degrees.  Lustig’s dedicated staffers provide extended, ongoing assistance to help graduates find work in an environment suitable for Haredi women. The growing trend of employing Haredi women in hi-tech —  a field that enables them to earn a respectable living, often with the convenience of working remotely, and is considered to be “the profession of the future” — is evident on the Haredi campuses, where many Haredi women go to earn a degree in computer science. Home Page Campuses Campus Lustig ... About Lustig About Lustig Located in Ramat Gan, near Tel Aviv, the Lustig Campus was established in 1998 to meet the specific needs of Haredi women and has since gained wide recognition for excellence.  Lustig offers women the environment and conditions necessary to pursue an advanced academic degree while maintaining the values and lifestyle of their ultra-Orthodox upbringing.   As a result, the campus empowers women — many of whom are the sole breadwinners in their families — to significantly improve their economic standing, while providing them access to professions that were previously inaccessible to the Haredi sector. The campus offers academic degree programs in Software Engineering, Computer Science, Business Administration, Accounting and Information Systems as well as teaching certifications in Managerial Accounting and Computer Science.  Since its establishment, Lustig has awarded over 1,000 academic degrees.  Lustig’s dedicated staffers provide extended, ongoing assistance to help graduates find work in an environment suitable for Haredi women. The growing trend of employing Haredi women in hi-tech —  a field that enables them to earn a respectable living, often with the convenience of working remotely, and is considered to be “the profession of the future” — is evident on the Haredi campuses, where many Haredi women go to earn a degree in computer science. The most prominent and well-established Haredi-friendly campus which offers degrees in this field is the Jerusalem College of Technology - Lev Academic Center's Lustig Campus, which completely separates men and women. Graduates have not only gone on to establish praiseworthy Jewish homes, they have also attained top managerial and development positions in industry, and have been awarded prizes for excellence both in Israel and abroad.  Equipped with a broad knowledge base along with practical skills and hands-on experience, 93% of Lustig graduates successfully integrate into Israel’s competitive job market in their field — one of the highest placement rates in the country. \"I was looking for a place that combines academic and religious studies, and I chose to study computer science at Lustig. This field enables me to earn a respectable living and support my family. As a graduate of the campus, as well as a lecturer there, I see how the Haredi graduates of this institution are extremely sought after by employers.\" Dr. Hadas Tschiler, a Haredi woman from Petach Tikvah, computer science lecturer at Lustig Campus and a Lustig graduate.

Beit Midrash Beit Midrash Located in the heart of JCT’s Lev Campus, the College’s beautiful Beit Midrash provides all Lev students the opportunity to combine daily Torah study and prayer with their academic pursuits.  The rigorous curriculum — which includes Tanach, Talmud, Jewish Law, Jewish Philosophy, Business Ethics and the synthesis of Torah and technology — provides students with the solid foundation necessary to cultivate an enduring commitment to Jewish values and integrate it into every aspect of their lives. JCT’s full-time Beit Midrash Program includes approximately 20 hours of Torah learning per week.  Under the strong leadership of JCT's Rosh Yeshiva, Rabbi Yosef Zvi Rimon, the Beit Midrash currently serves over 400 students and that number continues to grow.  From the early morning hours until late at night, students can be found in the Beit Midrash engaged in prayer or Talmudic discourse.  Divided into small groups and chevrutot according to their abilities, students receive ongoing guidance by a devoted staff of learned Torah scholars, rabbis and educators and are tested on a regular basis.  Despite the demanding hours of a double curriculum (Beit Midrash in the morning and academic studies in the afternoon/evening), these dedicated students are highly motivated to learn Torah and strengthen their connection to the land of Israel.  Many serve in the IDF in hesder or atudai programs before or after their studies at JCT.  Firmly rooted in Jewish heritage, JCT students have made and continue to make remarkable contributions to advancing the State of Israel. The Beit Midrash website also provides the wider public with access to Beit Midrash activities through its extensive library of online audio and video shiurim. Please see the Beit Midrash website for updated information regarding upcoming activities, calendar of weekly s hiurim and davening times. Scholarships The College places a very high priority on providing all Campus Lev students access to Beit Midrash scholarships as modest but significant living stipends.  Highly motivated in their efforts to continue investing in their Torah learning while pursuing an academic education, these scholarships provide our students with critical financial assistance.  Scholarship amounts are determined by criteria that include army service, marital status, number of children and year of study.

However students should check with specific colleges as each has different requirements for transfer credits. Questions? Israel Defense Prize for JCT Alum Home Page News and Updates ... Israel Defense Prize for JCT Alum Col. Yaniv Avitan, a graduate of the Jerusalem College of Technology’s (JCT) Electro-Optics Engineering Department, received the 2018 Israel Defense Prize from the Israeli Ministry of Defense for his role heading a team that works to detect the Hamas terror group’s cross-border attack tunnels. This marks the second consecutive year and the fourth time in the past decade that a JCT graduate has received this prestigious award. Avitan is head of the Collection and Assault Unit of the Technological Division of the Ground Forces of the Israel Defense Forces (IDF). His team developed \"The Brain\" which is a nickname for the laboratory they established in 2016 and in the last two years has located nine of Hamas’s underground tunnels that were dug from the Gaza Strip into Israeli territory. The team includes experts from the IDF, the Ministry of Defense, academic institutions, and the defense industry. As modern electro-optics applications are increasingly implemented in electronics, modern communications, medicine, data processing, energy, and especially the security field, JCT’s electro-optics department prepares professionals for R&D work by providing them with a strong foundation in applied physics, electronics, and computers. Graduates of the electro-optics program master the planning of optical systems and instruments, lasers and other light sources, photoelectric light detectors, electro-optic light modulation, holography, devices for television photography as well as night vision devices, and computer assisted lens design. The threat of Hamas’s cross-border tunnel network was particularly prominent during Israel’s 2014 summer war in Gaza. The IDF destroyed more than 30 of the so-called “terror tunnels” during that conflict, but the military continues to discover and dismantle the tunnels today, several years after Operation Protective Edge. Avitan, aged 42, grew up in Netivot and lives in Sderot, both situated in southern Israel near the Gaza border—meaning the tunnel threat and other forms of terrorism have long been a reality of his daily life. He has researched the Hamas tunnels since 2013. “We developed an algorithm into which data was fed, combined with assessments of the security situation and decisions about where to drill, where to dig, where to attack, and what to handle,” says Avitan. “The breakthrough was not only technological, but also in the way people worked - technology professionals left their laboratories and went out in the field, in complete contrast to the norms of their military service. Various defense industries joined the Lab. There were great challenges, but everyone went full steam ahead. We are pretty confident in the method. It speaks for itself when it comes to locating tunnels.” Avitan calls his team’s tunnel-detection breakthrough “a highlight of my career.” When asked why he chose to stay in the army when using his skills to develop a start-up could potentially make him millions, Avitan simply stated that the fields outside of the army \"can't provide the sense of meaning that IDF service offers.\" “The most dramatic moment was the first time the system proved itself,” he recalls. “You hit the tunnel and it’s very exciting. As a resident of the area, I understand very well what this means for civilians. The tunnel that we most recently detected (about a month ago) threatened the lives of IDF soldiers and residents of the Gaza vicinity. It was discovered a short distance from where my family lives.\" share in social medias: Previous Update Next Update More Updates Where does Israel go from here?

JCT - A massive Engine in Integrating Haredim into Academia Home Page News and Updates ... Yaffa Zilbershatz 50th Anniversary to JCT. \"We fully believe in combining high-level technological studies alongside the preservation of Torah life without compromise.\" september 2019 The Lev Academic Center in Jerusalem celebrated tonight (Thursday) its 50 th anniversary.  Attending the event were Minister of transportation, Bezalel Smotrich, Mayor of Jerusalem, Moshe Leon and Deputy Mayor, Fleur Hassan, who holds the portfolio of external affairs in the city . Also participating were Prof. Yaffa Zilberschatz, Chairman of the Planning and budgeting Committee of the Council of Higher Education, Professor Chaim Sukenik, President of JCT, Yossi Zeira, JCT CEO, Kenneth Hochberg, JCT rector and Kurt Rothschild, co-founder of JCT . Professor Zilberschatz said in her speech that the \"Lev Academic Center plays a central role in the important national mission of integrating Ethiopian population into the Israeli Academy. In addition, JCT is worthy of all praise and mention for its enlistment in making higher education accessible to the Haredi population, spearheading the cracking of this complex challenge of integrating Haredim into academia. “The haredim insist on gender separated campuses as a condition of their entry into the academic system while large parts of the academic system oppose this step. As a result, it is only natural for Lev Academic Center, an institution which from its inception was established with the concept of separate gender campuses, to have the opportunity be a huge engine in the integration of the Haredim into the higher education system .\" Zilberschatz also emphasized that \"if you wish to fulfill the idea of [combining] Torah and Science, then the Lev Academic Center is the best place to go \". The mayor of Jerusalem, Moshe Leon, shared \"in two weeks, we will mark the 15 th anniversary of the passing of Israel Prize winner Professor Ze'ev Lev, founder of the Lev Academic Center. Prof. Lev was a yeshiva student with rabbinic lineage and a scientist. He hoped that the combination of these two strong elements -- Torah and science - - in founding the Lev Academic Center, would produce a massive force multiplier . Professor Lev was a man of actions and vision, and I doubt that in his wildest dreams he envisioned that JCT would develop so rapidly and affect in such an immeasurable way the integration of Haredim into the Israeli society . The thousands of Haredim - who have completed their secondary schooling and academic degree at JCT, who now succeed in integrating in their lives Torah, science, livelihood and ‘Derech Eretz’ - will attest to that,\" Leon said . The Rabbinic Head of Lev Academic Center, Rabbi Yosef Zvi Rimon, noted that \"in the Lev Academic Center we get to integrate Torah and science, and I'm excited to see a lively Beit Midrash here. Every class is full of questions and discussions, and the students here live Torah life in its fullest, along with the highest level of academia. Today I know that the more you learn and deepen in the Beit Midrash, the more successful you are in the academia. There's an amazing thing going on here in the institution, when the Torah creates energy and power to do things beyond imagination .\" Prof. Chaim Sukenik, JCT President, said that \"Professor Lev and Kurt Rothschild faced a huge task convincing the regulators to support the establishment of another institution of higher education in Jerusalem based on a combination of the world of Torah and science. Professor Lev's message was that all challenges could be met and a proof for that are our graduates who fill senior sensitive positions in the defense industry and high-tech fields . Nowadays, there are, unfortunately many parties of interests that are trying to harm an institution that combines Torah learning without compromising values, but we believe entirely ן n our cause, and in the need to preserve technological education at the highest level alongside maintaining uncompromising Torah life,\" Sukenik said . share in social medias: Previous Update Next Update More Updates Where does Israel go from here?
